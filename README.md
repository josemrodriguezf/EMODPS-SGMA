This repository contains the Python scripts used for the computational experiments and visualization of the results for the manuscript: 
Identifying robust adaptive irrigation operating policies to balance deeply uncertain economic food production and groundwater sustainability trade-offs

If you use anaconda I recommend to download them using conda-forge Pyomo (Optimization labrary for python) install version: 5.7.11 Ipopt (Optimization solver) install version: 3.13.3 --- this is very important the pyomo and ipopt versions must be compatible

pymc: 4.0.0 (pypi) Pymc3 (Bayesian statistics package): 3.11.4 See documentation https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/ theano-pymc: 1.1.2 arviz: 0.11.2 - this might be installed when you install pymc altair: 4.1.0

The rest of the libraries are: numpy, pandas, scipy, stats models, pickle, random, matplotlib, json and seaborn.
