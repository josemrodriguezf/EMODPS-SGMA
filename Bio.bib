	abstract = {Irrigated agriculture has grown rapidly over the last 50 years, helping food production keep pace with population growth, but also leading to significant habitat and biodiversity loss globally. Now, in some regions, land degradation and overtaxed water resources mean historical production levels may need to be reduced. We demonstrate how analytically supported planning for habitat restoration in stressed agricultural landscapes can recover biodiversity and create co-benefits during transitions to sustainability. We apply our approach in California’s San Joaquin Valley where groundwater regulations are driving significant land use change. We link agricultural-economic and land use change models to generate plausible landscapes with different cropping patterns, including temporary fallowing and permanent retirement. We find that a large fraction of the reduced cultivation is met through temporary fallowing, but still estimate over 86,000 hectares of permanent retirement. We then apply systematic conservation planning to identify optimized restoration solutions that secure at least 10,000 hectares of high quality habitat for each of five representative endangered species, accounting for spatially varying opportunity costs specific to each plausible future landscape. The analyses identified consolidated areas common to all land use scenarios where restoration could be targeted to enhance habitat by utilizing land likely to be retired anyway, and by shifting some retirement from regions with low habitat value to regions with high habitat value. We also show potential co-benefits of retirement (derived from avoided nitrogen loadings and soil carbon sequestration), though these require careful consideration of additionality. Our approach provides a generalizable means to inform multi-benefit adaptation planning in response to agricultural stressors.},

	abstract = {The Upper Basin of the Colorado River in the southwestern United States supports municipal, industrial, agricultural, and recreational activities worth an estimated \$300 billion/year within the state of Colorado alone. The allocation of water to these activities is fundamentally shaped by water rights that in turn distribute risks among a diverse suite of sectors and stakeholders. In this study, we assess the vulnerabilities faced by the hierarchy of hundreds of water users in the portion of the Upper Basin within the state of Colorado, as a result of changes in hydrologic extremes, demand growth, and institutional and physical infrastructure in the basin. We also determine how robust the different users are to these potential changes, examining how their sensitivity to these factors depends on the magnitude and frequency of shortage they are unwilling to exceed. This advances previous robustness evaluation methods by formalizing an a posteriori exploration of alternative definitions of robustness tailored to each user's unique context. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies significantly not only across users but also across different definitions of acceptable performance for each user. We further show the importance of using scenario discovery to evaluate how the factors that drive consequential scenarios differ depending on the definition of robustness. Our results highlight the need for robustness and vulnerability frameworks to avoid broad categorical aggregations of stakeholder groups, to carefully capture complex institutional dependencies (e.g., water rights), and to facilitate a more transparent illustration of the implications of alternative definitions of robustness for specific stakeholders.},

We capture adjustments along the land use and input intensity margins by calibrating a regionalized optimization model of California crop production to economic and agronomic information. Second-best policies relying on spatially aggregated GHG emission factors lead to small abatement efﬁciency losses, while policies targeting a single GHG lead to moderate losses. In contrast, policies targeting a single input entail large abatement eﬃciency losses, which nonetheless can be reduced by combining instruments. Realizing part of agriculture’s GHG mitigation potential thus appears to be within policy reach.},

	abstract = {Climate change can aﬀect a region's environment and economy through changes in water resource ﬂows and allocations. The hydrologic and economic components of these impacts require complex models to reﬂect both the environment's physical and individuals' behavioral responses to climate change. This paper describes a model that combines the strengths of the State Wide Economic Agricultural Production Model (SWAP), an agricultural economic optimization model, and Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP), a climate-driven hydrological model. A step function approximation of water demand curves from SWAP is used in an iterative search process to estimate crop land allocation based on annual regional water availability and economic value. SWAP value functions serve as input for an optimal discretization of water demand functions. The methodological integration of the SWAP and WEAP models creates the EconWEAP model. This paper shows the improved analytic ability of this integration by comparing agricultural revenues from WEAP vs. EconWEAP. Results for EconWEAP runs in the California's Central Valley show a signiﬁcant increase in revenues for the Central Valley, maintaining the same hydrology, through the economically optimal allocation of water. This integration approach can be applied to other types of economic and hydrologic models.},

	abstract = {Increasing attention to regime shifts, critical transitions, non-marginal changes, and systemic shocks calls for the development of models that are able to reproduce or grow structural changes that occur over time periods perceived as abrupt. This paper highlights specific modelling challenges to consider when exploring coupled socio-environmental systems experiencing regime shifts. We explore these challenges in the context of four modelling approaches that have been applied to the study of regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: statistical, system dynamics, equilibrium and agent-based modelling. When reviewing these modelling approaches we reflect on a set of criteria including the ability of an approach (1) to capture feedbacks between social and environmental system, (2) to represent the sources of regime shifts, (3) to incorporate complexity aspects, and (4) to deal with regime shift identification. Many of the modelling examples considered do not provide information on all these criteria, which receive a lot of attention in empirical studies of registered regime shifts. This suggests a need to develop a common modelling terminology in the domain of modelling for resilience and regime shifts. When discussing strengths and weaknesses of various modelling paradigms we conclude that a hybrid approach is likely to provide most insights into the processes and consequences of regime shifts. Challenges and frontier directions of research for designing models to study regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems are outlined.},

A number of recent studies aim to identify policies mapping future observations to actions—in other words, framing climate adaptation as an optimal control problem. This paper uses the control paradigm to review and classify recent dynamic planning studies according to their approaches to uncertainty characterization, policy structure, and solution methods. We propose a set of research gaps and opportunities in this area centered on the challenge of characterizing uncertainty, which prevents the unambiguous application of control methods to this problem. These include exogenous uncertainty in forcing, model structure, and parameters propagated through a chain of climate and hydrologic models; endogenous uncertainty in human-environmental system dynamics across multiple scales; and sampling uncertainty due to the finite length of historical observations and future projections. Recognizing these challenges, several opportunities exist to improve the use of control methods for climate adaptation, namely, how problem context and understanding of climate processes might assist with uncertainty quantification and experimental design, out-of-sample validation and robustness of optimized adaptation policies, and monitoring and data assimilation, including trend detection, Bayesian inference, and indicator variable selection. We conclude with a summary of recommendations for dynamic water resources planning under climate change through the lens of optimal control.},

The increasing availability of observations describing these systems provides the opportunity to infer a set of plausible model structures using data-driven approaches. This study develops a three-phase approach to the inference of model structures and parameterizations from data: problem definition, model generation, and model evaluation, illustrated on a case study of land use decisions in the Tulare Basin, California. We encode the generalized decision problem as an arbitrary mapping from a high-dimensional data space to the action of interest and use multiobjective genetic programming to search over a family of functions that perform this mapping for both regression and classification tasks. To facilitate the discovery of models that are both realistic and interpretable, the algorithm selects model structures based on multiobjective optimization of (1) their performance on a training set and (2) complexity, measured by the number of variables, constants, and operations composing the model. After training, optimal model structures are further evaluated according to their ability to generalize to held-out test data and clustered based on their performance, complexity, and generalization properties. Finally, we diagnose the causes of good and bad generalization by performing sensitivity analysis across model inputs and within model clusters. This study serves as a template to inform and automate the problem-dependent task of constructing robust data-driven model structures to describe human behavior in water resources systems.},

MORDM has four phases: a systems analytical problem formulation, a search phase to generate candidate solutions, a trade-off analysis where different strategies are compared across many objectives, and a scenario discovery phase to identify the vulnerabilities. In its original inception, the search phase identiﬁes optimal strategies for a single reference scenario for deep uncertainties, which may result in missing locally near-optimal, but globally more robust strategies. Recent work has addressed this issue by generating candidate strategies for multiple policy-relevant scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate a systematic scenario selection procedure in the search phase to consider both policy relevance and scenario diversity. The results demonstrate an increased tradeoff variety besides higher robustness, compared to the solutions found for a reference scenario. Future research can routinize multi-scenario search in MORDM with the aid of software packages.},

Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y = f ( X1, X2, . . . , Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisﬁed with computing just k ﬁrst order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, deﬁned in terms of number of evaluations of f ( X1, X2, . . . , Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f ( X1, X2, . . . , Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating ﬁrst order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.},

However, methods that consider the entire Probability Density Function (PDF) of the model output, rather than its variance only, are preferable in cases where variance is not an adequate proxy of uncertainty, e.g. when the output distribution is highly-skewed or when it is multi-modal. Still, the adoption of density-based methods has been limited so far, possibly because they are relatively more difﬁcult to implement. Here we present a novel GSA method, called PAWN, to efﬁciently compute density-based sensitivity indices. The key idea is to characterise output distributions by their Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF), which are easier to derive than PDFs. We discuss and demonstrate the advantages of PAWN through applications to numerical and environmental modelling examples. We expect PAWN to increase the application of density-based approaches and to be a complementary approach to variance-based GSA.},

Where efforts to achieve sustainable groundwater management require reductions in aggregate extraction, some of these reductions will entail a decline in agricultural production. However, the degree to which water conservation and other environmental priorities conﬂict with agricultural production depends, in part, on the spatial conﬁguration of land-use decisions. We explore how to spatially conﬁgure groundwater recharge projects to achieve groundwater recharge targets and preserve ecologically important habitat at the least cost. We conduct a ﬁeld-level analysis for all ﬁelds in Kern County, California, the largest crop-producing county in California (and the United States). Results demonstrate that ﬁelds selected for cost-effective land retirement can achieve groundwater recharge targets and simultaneously contribute to biodiversity goals via endangered species habitat conservation. However, increasing the amount of habitat conserved raises costs signiﬁcantly. We discuss conservation actions, economic incentives, and policies that can be leveraged to meet regional biodiversity goals while preserving the economic vitality of agricultural communities.},

	abstract = {Exponentially growing water demands and increasingly uncertain hydrologic regimes due to changes in climate and land use are challenging the sustainability of agricultural water systems. Farmers must adapt their management strategies in order to secure food production and avoid crop failures. Investigating the potential for adaptation policies in agricultural systems requires accounting for their natural and human components, along with their reciprocal interactions. Yet this feedback is generally overlooked in the water resources systems literature. In this work, we contribute a novel modeling approach to study the coevolution of irrigated agriculture under changing climate, advancing the representation of the human component within agricultural systems by using normative meta-models to describe the behaviors of groups of farmers or institutional decisions. These behavioral models, validated against observational data, are then integrated into a coupled human-natural system simulation model to better represent both systems and their coevolution under future changing climate conditions, assuming the adoption of different policy adaptation options, such as cultivating less water demanding crops. The application to the pilot study of the Adda River basin in northern Italy shows that the dynamic coadaptation of water supply and demand allows farmers to avoid estimated potential losses of more than 10 Me/yr under projected climate changes, while unilateral adaptation of either the water supply or the demand are both demonstrated to be less effective. Results also show that the impact of the different policy options varies as function of drought intensity, with water demand adaptation outperforming water supply adaptation when drought conditions become more severe.},

However, SGMA’s current definition of sustainable yield does not offer clear guidance for new agencies and lacks grounding in physics. This study presents a novel hydrologically based framework for quantifying sustainable yield under SGMA that is derived from a synthesis of scientific inquiry and analysis. We introduce a flexible three-step approach that basin managers can rely on to quantify sustainable yield values, incorporate the impact of “undesirable results”, and analyze groundwater sustainability over SGMA’s implementation horizon. Our framework is illustrated through a case study of the South San Joaquin Irrigation District, a proposed GSA in one of California’s critically overdrafted groundwater basins. We calculate sustainable yield for three different management scenarios and assess the impact of each scenario on future groundwater sustainability by performing an annual water groundwater balance through 2040. Our sustainable yield framework can be used as a basis for the development of SGMA’s groundwater management plans throughout California.},

We present an overview of available methods, structuring them into local and global methods. For local methods, we discuss Tornado Diagrams, One Way sensitivity functions, diﬀerentiation-based methods and scenario decomposition through ﬁnite change sensitivity indices, providing a uniﬁed view of the associated sensitivity measures. We then analyze global sensitivity methods, ﬁrst discussing screening methods such as sequential bifurcation and the Morris method. We then address variance-based, moment-independent and value of information-based sensitivity methods. We discuss their formalization in a common rationale and present recent results that permit the estimation of global sensitivity measures by post-processing the sample generated by a traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We then investigate in detail the methodological issues concerning the crucial step of correctly interpreting the results of a sensitivity analysis.

Fortunately, there are new approaches, such as Robust Decision Making (RDM), that exploit increasingly capable computer tools and are well suited for such situations. RDM rests on a simple concept: Rather than using models and data to describe a bestestimate future, RDM runs models many hundreds to thousands of times to determine how plans perform in a range of plausible futures. Visualization and statistical analysis of the resulting database of runs then help decisionmakers distinguish those future conditions in which their plans perform well from those in which their plans perform poorly, assisting them in making their plans more robust. This research highlight discusses how RDM works and illustrates its benefits through two example applications: helping a water management agency adaptively plan for climate change and determining whether federal terrorism insurance would cost or save taxpayers money.},

	abstract = {Climate change presents a signiﬁcant planning challenge for water management agencies in the western United States. Changing precipitation and temperature patterns will disrupt their supply and extensive distribution systems over the coming decades, but the precise timing and extent of these impacts remain deeply uncertain, complicating decisions on needed investments in infrastructure and other system improvements. Adaptive strategies represent an obvious solution in principle, but are often difﬁcult to develop and implement in practice. This paper describes work helping the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA) explicitly develop adaptive policies to respond to climate change and integrating these policies into the organizations' long-range planning processes. The analysis employs Robust Decision Making (RDM), a quantitative decision- analytic approach for supporting decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty. RDM studies use simulation models to assess the performance of agency plans over thousands of plausible futures, use statistical “scenario discovery” algorithms to concisely summarize those futures where the plans fail to perform adequately, and use these resulting scenarios to help decisionmakers understand the vulnerabilities of their plans and assess the options for ameliorating these vulnerabilities. This paper demonstrates the particular value of RDM in helping decisionmakers to design and evaluate adaptive strategies. For IEUA, the RDM analysis suggests the agency's current plan could perform poorly and lead to high shortage and water provisioning costs under conditions of: (1) large declines in precipitation, (2) larger-than-expected impacts of climate change on the availability of imported supplies, and (3) reductions in percolation of precipitation into the region's groundwater basin. Including adaptivity in the current plan eliminates 72\% of the high-cost outcomes. Accelerating efforts in expanding the size of one of the agency's groundwater banking programs and implementing its recycling program, while monitoring the region's supply and demand balance and making additional investments in efﬁciency and storm-water capture if shortages are projected provides one promising robust adaptive strategy — it eliminates more than 80\% of the initially-identiﬁed high-cost outcomes.},

	abstract = {Abrupt systemic changes in ecological and socio-economic systems are a regular occurrence. While there has been much attention to studying systemic changes primarily in ecology as well as in economics, the attempts to do so for coupled socio-environmental systems are rarer. This paper bridges the gap by reviewing how models can be instrumental in exploring signiﬁcant, fundamental changes in such systems. The history of modelling systemic change in various disciplines contains a range of deﬁnitions and approaches. Even so, most of these efforts share some common challenges within the modelling context. We propose a framework drawing these challenges together, and use it to discuss the articles in this thematic issue on modelling systemic change in coupled social and environmental systems. The differing approaches used highlight that modelling systemic change is an area of endeavour that would beneﬁt from greater synergies between the various disciplines concerned with systemic change.},

Flexible functional forms including the Box-Cox specification and the nonlinear almost ideal demand system are estimated and bootstrap standard errors obtained. Partial adjustment models are used to model the supply side. These models provide good approximations in which to obtain elasticity estimates. The six commodities selected represent some of the highest valued crops in California. The commodities are: almonds, walnuts, alfalfa, cotton, rice, and tomatoes (fresh and processed). All of the estimated own-price demand elasticities are inelastic and, in general, the income elasticities are all less than one. On the supply side, all the short-run price elasticities are inelastic. The long-run price elasticities are all greater than their short-run counterparts. The long-run price supply elasticities for cotton, almonds and alfalfa are elastic, i.e., greater than one. Policy makers can use these estimates to measure the changes in welfare of consumers and producers with respect to changes in policies and economic variables.},

Recent studies have shown that the application of different robustness metrics can result in different rankings of decision alternatives, but there has been little discussion of what potential causes for this might be. To shed some light on this issue, we present a unifying framework for the calculation of robustness metrics, which assists with understanding how robustness metrics work, when they should be used, and why they sometimes disagree. The framework categorizes the suitability of metrics to a decision-maker based on (1) the decision-context (i.e., the suitability of using absolute performance or regret), (2) the decision-maker's preferred level of risk aversion, and (3) the decision-maker's preference toward maximizing performance, minimizing variance, or some higher-order moment. This article also introduces a conceptual framework describing when relative robustness values of decision alternatives obtained using different metrics are likely to agree and disagree. This is used as a measure of how “stable” the ranking of decision alternatives is when determined using different robustness metrics. The framework is tested on three case studies, including water supply augmentation in Adelaide, Australia, the operation of a multipurpose regulated lake in Italy, and flood protection for a hypothetical river based on a reach of the river Rhine in the Netherlands. The proposed conceptual framework is confirmed by the case study results, providing insight into the reasons for disagreements between rankings obtained using different robustness metrics.},

The CALFEWS simulation framework links the operation of state-wide, interbasin transfer projects (i.e., State Water Project, Central Valley Project) with coordinated water management strategies abstracted to the scale of irrigation/water districts. This study contributes a historic baseline (October 1996–September 2016) evaluation of the model's performance against observations, including reservoir storage, inter-basin transfers, environmental endpoints, and groundwater banking accounts. State-aware, rules-based representations of critical component systems enable CALFEWS to simulate adaptive management responses to alternative climate, infrastructure, and regulatory scenarios. Moreover, CALFEWS has been designed to maintain interoperability with electric power dispatch and agricultural production models. As such, CALFEWS provides a platform to evaluate internally consistent scenarios for the integrated management of water supply, energy generation, and food production.},

Therefore, energy pricing policies can significantly influence the use of scarce groundwater resources. This article leverages unique well-level data on groundwater use, electricity prices, and pumping efficiency from the Republican River Basin of Colorado to estimate producer responses to changes in marginal energy prices. Empirical parameter estimates are used to simulate a change in energy pricing policy from existing decreasing block rate structures to a revenue-neutral uniform marginal price. The simulation results reveal that, on average, uniform energy pricing leads to an 11\% decrease in groundwater use than would occur under a decreasing block rate pricing regime. However, a transition to uniform energy pricing diminishes short-run producer welfare. More broadly, the results illustrate how energy pricing has important implications for groundwater management and informs a more comprehensive understanding of how priced inputs influence the use of unpriced natural resources.},

This paper examines three regions (Spain, California, and the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia) which share similar social and climatic characteristics and face severe water-scarcity problems. The frequency and persistence of droughts in these regions over the last few decades have triggered changes in water laws as well as in the behaviour of water users and managers. This paper compares the major water reforms in these regions and the achievements and failures of the various approaches implemented. This comparison shows how, despite the diﬀerences in institutions and governance regarding water allocation in the three regions, recent droughts have catalysed the creation of institutions and the implementation of sophisticated long-term measures to mitigate the impact of future droughts. A deeper understanding of the eﬀectiveness of mechanisms and regulations is necessary to better manage droughts since the uncertain impacts of climate change will require responses of a more eﬀective nature.},

In this article, we analyse the effects of the latest multi-year drought (2011–2016) in agricultural production in California; impacts on food security; and coping responses of several actors. We found that despite the drought and water shortages, California continued to be the leading state for fruit and tree nuts and that it did not affect food security. We also found that these results were strongly influenced by the numerous policy, regulatory, institutional, and management decisions taken at the local, state and federal levels, as well as to availability of groundwater, the primary drought reserve. The California case can be considered an example for the rest of the country, and the world, that extreme events require extraordinary preparedness and response measures just to cope with them, not to mention adapting to them, and that building resilience is a long-term process.},

Once calibrated, these models are used for water management and analysis assuming they remain valid under future conditions. In this paper, we present and demonstrate a methodology that permits the recursive calibration of economic models of agricultural production from noisy but frequently available data. We use a standard economic calibration approach, namely positive mathematical programming, integrated in a data assimilation algorithm based on the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter equations to identify the economic model parameters. A moving average kernel ensures that new and past information on agricultural activity are blended during the calibration process, avoiding loss of information and overcalibration for the conditions of a single year. A regularization constraint akin to the standard Tikhonov regularization is included in the ﬁlter to ensure its stability even in the presence of parameters with low sensitivity to observations. The results show that the implementation of the PMP methodology within a data assimilation framework based on the enKF equations is an effective method to calibrate models of agricultural production even with noisy information. The recursive nature of the method incorporates new information as an added value to the known previous observations of agricultural activity without the need to store historical information. The robustness of the method opens the door to the use of new remote sensing algorithms for operational water management.},

The implied statewide elasticity of demand for nitrogen is minimally affected by the choice of shadow values, however predicted environmental outcomes differ as this choice affects the distribution of nitrogen across regions and crops.},

Integrated hydro-economic models capable of simulating the hydrologic system in irrigated and non-irrigated regions including the response of farmers to hydrologic constraints and economic and policy incentives, provide a framework to understand biophysical and socioeconomic implications of changing water availability. We present a transformative hydro-economic model of agricultural production driven by multi-sensor satellite observations, outputs from regional climate models, and socioeconomic data. Our approach overcomes the limitations of current decision support systems for agricultural water management and provides policymakers and natural resource managers with satellite data-driven, state-wide, operational models capable of anticipating how farmers allocate water, land, and other resources when confronted with new climate patterns, policy rules, or market signals. The model can also quantify how farming decisions aﬀect agricultural water supplies. We demonstrate the model through an application in the state of Montana.},

	abstract = {Water systems planners have long recognized the need for robust solutions capable of withstanding deviations from the conditions for which they were designed. Robustness analyses have shifted from expected utility to exploratory bottom-up approaches which identify vulnerable scenarios prior to assigning likelihoods. Examples include Robust Decision Making (RDM), Decision Scaling, Info-Gap, and Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM). We propose a taxonomy of robustness frameworks to compare and contrast these approaches based on their methods of (1) alternative generation, (2) sampling of states of the world, (3) quantification of robustness measures, and (4) sensitivity analysis to identify important uncertainties. Building from the proposed taxonomy, we use a regional urban water supply case study in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina to illustrate the decision-relevant consequences that emerge from each of these choices. Results indicate that the methodological choices in the taxonomy lead to the selection of substantially different planning alternatives, underscoring the importance of an informed definition of robustness. Moreover, the results show that some commonly employed methodological choices and definitions of robustness can have undesired consequences when ranking decision alternatives. For the demonstrated test case, recommendations for overcoming these issues include: (1) decision alternatives should be searched rather than prespecified, (2) dominant uncertainties should be discovered through sensitivity analysis rather than assumed, and (3) a carefully elicited multivariate satisficing measure of robustness allows stakeholders to achieve their problem-specific performance requirements. This work emphasizes the importance of an informed problem formulation for systems facing challenging performance tradeoffs and provides a common vocabulary to link the robustness frameworks widely used in the field of water systems planning.

	abstract = {This paper introduces many objective robust decision making (MORDM). MORDM combines concepts and methods from many objective evolutionary optimization and robust decision making (RDM), along with extensive use of interactive visual analytics, to facilitate the management of complex environmental systems. Many objective evolutionary search is used to generate alternatives for complex planning problems, enabling the discovery of the key tradeoffs among planning objectives. RDM then determines the robustness of planning alternatives to deeply uncertain future conditions and facilitates decision makers’ selection of promising candidate solutions. MORDM tests each solution under the ensemble of future extreme states of the world (SOW). Interactive visual analytics are used to explore whether solutions of interest are robust to a wide range of plausible future conditions (i.e., assessment of their Pareto satisﬁcing behavior in alternative SOW). Scenario discovery methods that use statistical data mining algorithms are then used to identify what assumptions and system conditions strongly inﬂuence the cost-effectiveness, efﬁciency, and reliability of the robust alternatives. The framework is demonstrated using a case study that examines a single city’s water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, USA. Results suggest that including robustness as a decision criterion can dramatically change the formulation of complex environmental management problems as well as the negotiated selection of candidate alternatives to implement. MORDM also allows decision makers to characterize the most important vulnerabilities for their systems, which should be the focus of ex post monitoring and identiﬁcation of triggers for adaptive management.},

	abstract = {The Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural locations in the world, which is made possible by a complex and vast irrigation system. Beginning in 2012, California endured one of the worst droughts in its history. Local impacts of the drought have been evaluated, but it is not yet well understood how the drought reverberated through the global food system. Here we quantify drought impacts to the water footprint (WF) of agricultural production and virtual water transfers (VWT) from the Central Valley of California. To do this, we utilize high-resolution spatial and temporal data sets and a crop model from predrought conditions (2011) through 3 years of exceptional drought (2012–2014). Despite a 12\% reduction in harvested area, the WF of agricultural production in the Central Valley increased by 3\%. This was due to greater crop water requirements from higher temperatures and a shift to more water-intensive orchard and vine crops. The groundwater WF increased from 7.00 km3 in 2011 to 13.63 km3 in 2014, predominantly in the Tulare Basin. Transfers of food commodities declined by 1\% during the drought, yet total VWT increased by 3\% (0.51 km3). From 2011 to 2014, groundwater VWT increased by 3.42 km3, offsetting the 0.94 km3 reduction in green VWT and the 1.96 km3 decrease in surface VWT. During the drought, local and global consumers nearly doubled their reliance on the Central Valley Aquifer. These results indicate that drought may strengthen the telecoupling between groundwater withdrawals and distant consumers of agricultural commodities.},

The variation of water values in time and space will increasingly motivate efforts to address water scarcity and reduce water conﬂicts. Hydro-economic models represent spatially distributed water resource systems, infrastructure, management options and economic values in an integrated manner. In these tools water allocations and management are either driven by the economic value of water or economically evaluated to provide policy insights and reveal opportunities for better management. A central concept is that water demands are not ﬁxed requirements but rather functions where quantities of water use at different times have varying total and marginal economic values. This paper reviews techniques to characterize the economic value of water use and include such values in mathematical models. We identify the key steps in model design and diverse problems, formulations, levels of integration, spatial and temporal scales, and solution techniques addressed and used by over 80 hydro-economic modeling efforts dating back 45-years from 23 countries. We list current limitations of the approach, suggest directions for future work, and recommend ways to improve policy relevance.},

Here, we explore the use of direct policy search (DPS) to design robust pollution control rules for the town that account for deeply uncertain system characteristics and conﬂicting objectives. The closed loop control formulation of DPS improves the quality and robustness of key management tradeoffs, while dramatically reducing the computational complexity of solving the multi-objective pollution control problem relative to open loop control strategies. These insights suggest DPS is a promising tool for managing socio-ecological systems with deeply uncertain tipping points.},

	abstract = {Hydropower generation in the Hetch Hetchy Power System is strongly tied to snowmelt dynamics in the central Sierra Nevada and consequently is particularly financially vulnerable to changes in snowpack availability and timing. This study explores the Hetchy Hetchy Power System as a representative example from the broader class of financial risk management problems that hold promise in helping utilities such as SFPUC to understand the tradeoffs across portfolios of risk mitigation instruments given uncertainties in snowmelt dynamics. An evolutionary multi-objective direct policy search (EMODPS) framework is implemented to identify time adaptive stochastic rules that map utility state information and exogenous inputs to optimal annual financial decisions. The resulting financial risk mitigation portfolio planning problem is mathematically difficult due to its high dimensionality and mixture of nonlinear, nonconvex, and discrete objectives. These features add to the difficulty of the problem by yielding a Pareto front of solutions that has a highly disjoint and complex geometry. In this study, we contribute a diagnostic assessment of state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms’ (MOEAs') abilities to support a DPS framework for managing financial risk. We perform comprehensive diagnostics on five algorithms: the Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (RVEA), and the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). The MOEAs are evaluated to characterize their controllability (ease-of-use), reliability (probability of success), efficiency (minimizing model evaluations), and effectiveness (high quality tradeoff representations). Our results show that newer decomposition, reference point, and reference vector algorithms are highly sensitive to their parameterizations (difficult to use), suffer from search deterioration (losing solutions), and have a strong likelihood of misrepresenting key tradeoffs. The results emphasize the importance of using MOEAs with archiving and adaptive search capabilities in order to solve complex financial risk portfolio problems in snow-dependent water-energy systems.},

	abstract = {Optimal management policies for water reservoir operation are generally designed via stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). Yet, the adoption of SDP in complex real-world problems is challenged by the three curses of dimensionality, modeling, and multiple objectives. These three curses considerably limit SDP’s practical application. Alternatively, this study focuses on the use of evolutionary multiobjective direct policy search (EMODPS), a simulation-based optimization approach that combines direct policy search, nonlinear approximating networks, and multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to design Pareto-approximate closed-loop operating policies for multipurpose water reservoirs. This analysis explores the technical and practical implications of using EMODPS through a careful diagnostic assessment of the effectiveness and reliability of the overall EMODPS solution design as well as of the resulting Pareto-approximate operating policies. The EMODPS approach is evaluated using the multipurpose Hoa Binh water reservoir in Vietnam, where water operators are seeking to balance the conflicting objectives of maximizing hydropower production and minimizing flood risks. A key choice in the EMODPS approach is the selection of alternative formulations for flexibly representing reservoir operating policies. This study distinguishes between the relative performance of two widely-used nonlinear approximating networks, namely artificial neural networks (ANNs) and radial basis functions (RBFs). The results show that RBF solutions are more effective than ANN ones in designing Pareto approximate policies for the Hoa Binh reservoir. Given the approximate nature of EMODPS, the diagnostic benchmarking uses SDP to evaluate the overall quality of the attained Pareto-approximate results. Although the Hoa Binh test case’s relative simplicity should maximize the potential value of SDP, the results demonstrate that EMODPS successfully dominates the solutions derived via SDP.},

	abstract = {Hydrologic variability can present severe financial challenges for organizations that rely on water for the provision of services, such as water utilities and hydropower producers. While recent decades have seen rapid growth in decision-support innovations aimed at helping utilities manage hydrologic uncertainty for multiple objectives, support for managing the related financial risks remains limited. However, the mathematical similarities between multi-objective reservoir control and financial risk management suggest that the two problems can be approached in a similar manner. This paper demonstrates the utility of Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search for developing adaptive policies for managing the drought-related financial risk faced by a hydropower producer. These policies dynamically balance a portfolio, consisting of snowpack-based financial hedging contracts, cash reserves, and debt, based on evolving system conditions. Performance is quantified based on four conflicting objectives, representing the classic tradeoff between “risk” and “return” in addition to decision-makers’ unique preferences toward different risk management instruments. The dynamic policies identified here significantly outperform static management formulations that are more typically employed for financial risk applications in the water resources literature. Additionally, this paper combines visual analytics and information theoretic sensitivity analysis to improve understanding about how different candidate policies achieve their comparative advantages through differences in how they adapt to realtime information. The methodology presented in this paper should be applicable to any organization subject to financial risk stemming from hydrology or other environmental variables (e.g., wind speed, insolation), including electric utilities, water utilities, agricultural producers, and renewable energy developers.},

The algorithm looks for the best closed-loop policy that can be represented using a given number of basis functions (BFs), where a discrete action is assigned to each BF. The type of the BFs and their number are speciﬁed in advance and determine the complexity of the representation. Considerable ﬂexibility is achieved by optimizing the locations and shapes of the BFs, together with the action assignments. The optimization is carried out with the cross-entropy method and evaluates the policies by their empirical return from a representative set of initial states. The return for each representative state is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting algorithm for crossentropy policy search with adaptive BFs is extensively evaluated in problems with two to six state variables, for which it reliably obtains good policies with only a small number of BFs. In these experiments, cross-entropy policy search requires vastly fewer BFs than value-function techniques with equidistant BFs, and outperforms policy search with a competing optimization algorithm called DIRECT.},

The multi-purpose HoaBinh water reservoir in Vietnam, accounting for hydropower production and flood control, is used as a case study.

Approaches for developing equitable and effective pumping allocations for drought are evaluated in the context of the 2012–2016 drought in Tulare County, California, USA. Potential economic impacts of policy alternatives on two user groups with conflicting interests are considered. Tradeoffs between losses of agricultural profit and response costs for domestic wells that run dry are estimated for various maximum groundwater depth policies. A welfare maximizing approach for identifying policies that limit depth to groundwater is evaluated and found to be ineffective because agricultural opportunity costs are much larger than domestic well costs. Adding a fee for additional drought groundwater pumping is proposed as a more impactful and balanced management policy approach. For the case study presented, a fee range of \$300 to \$600/acre-foot (\$300–\$600/1,233 m3) yielded an effective groundwater management policy for reducing domestic well impacts from drought and balancing agricultural impacts of drought with the need to replenish additional drought pumping in wetter years. Recent management policies enacted in the study area agree with this finding.

The analysis is conducted with a hydro-economic model that includes a calibrated economic model and a semi-distributed calibrated hydrogeological model. First, we analyse the system currently used to manage groundwater abstraction. It includes a flexible quota system, revised annually as a function of the state of the groundwater, combined with a tax. This dual system performs better than a single instrument because of regional hydrogeological and economic specificities, as well as the fact that it limits costs for farming. We then investigate the impact of alternative combinations of instruments. Our findings show that the most cost-effective and robust way to improve the groundwater state is to increase the economic component (a flexible tax) in association with a flexible quota system.},

We adopt an innovative multi-model ensemble of mathematical programming models to assess irrigators' responses to pecuniary compensations designed to sustain irrigation-dependent ecosystem services (Payments for Watershed Services-PWS), under multiple scenarios. The upshot is a database of forecasts that represents the range of plausible future states, which is used to assess economic performance and identify a robust adaptation strategy to growing scarcity. Our analysis of the Reno River Land Reclamation and Irrigation Board in NE Italy shows that, under most models and scenarios, the conservationist strategy has a superior economic performance than the autonomous adaptation strategy where modern irrigation systems are adopted. The conservationist strategy is also found more robust than the autonomous strategy. However, unless sensible incentives are put in place, irrigators may adopt irrigation technologies nonetheless. Under mild to moderate climate change scenarios, removing existing subsidies to modern irrigation systems is sufficient to deter their adoption. Under severe climate change scenarios, additional PWS to irrigators will be necessary to ensure the sustainability of irrigation-dependent ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {As in many places, groundwater in California (USA) is the major alternative water source for agriculture during drought, so groundwater’s availability will drive some inevitable changes in the state’s water management. Currently, agricultural, environmental, and urban uses compete for groundwater, resulting in substantial overdraft in dry years with lowering of water tables, which in turn increases pumping costs and reduces groundwater pumping capacity. In this study, SWAP (an economic model of agricultural production and water use in California) and C2VISim (the California Department of Water Resources groundwater model for California’s Central Valley) are connected. This paper examines the economic costs of pumping replacement groundwater during drought and the potential loss of pumping capacity as groundwater levels drop. A scenario of three additional drought years continuing from 2014 show lower water tables in California’s Central Valley and loss of pumping capacity. Places without access to groundwater and with uncertain surface-water deliveries during drought are the most economically vulnerable in terms of crop revenues, employment and household income. This is particularly true for Tulare Lake Basin, which relies heavily on water imported from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Remote-sensing estimates of idle agricultural land between 2012 and 2014 confirm this finding. Results also point to the potential of a portfolio approach for agriculture, in which crop mixing and conservation practices have substantial roles.},

	abstract = {In 2014, California passed legislation requiring the sustainable management of critically overdrafted groundwater basins, located primarily in the Central Valley agricultural region. Hydroeconomic modeling of the agricultural economy, groundwater, and surface water systems is critically important to simulate potential transition paths to sustainable management of the basins. The requirement for sustainable groundwater use by 2040 is mandated for many overdrafted groundwater basins that are decoupled from environmental and river flow effects. We argue that, for such cases, a modeling approach that integrates a biophysical response function from a hydrologic model into an economic model of groundwater use is preferable to embedding an economic response function in a complex hydrologic model as is more commonly done. Using this preferred approach, we develop a dynamic hydroeconomic model for the Kings and Tulare Lake subbasins of California and evaluate three groundwater management institutions—open access, perfect foresight, and managed pumping. We quantify the costs and benefits of sustainable groundwater management, including energy pumping savings, drought reserve values, and avoided capital costs. Our analysis finds that, for basins that are severely depleted, losses in crop net revenue are offset by the benefits of energy savings, drought reserve value, and avoided capital costs. This finding provides an empirical counterexample to the Gisser and Sanchez Effect.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

However, popular and well-intentioned water conservation and management policies, including those that encourage the adoption of more efficient irrigation technology, may have unintended and possibly perverse consequences if policy-makers do not account for water users’ behavioral responses to their policies. In particular, a Jevons’ Paradox may arise, whereby a technology that enhances the efficiency of using a natural resource does not necessarily lead to less consumption of that resource.

Either climate change or reservoir operations are among the main drivers of changes in the flow regime of rivers globally. Using modeled unregulated and simulated regulated streamflow under historical and future climate scenarios, this study evaluated potential changes to the flow regime due to climate change and reservoir operations for the major tributaries of the San Joaquin River Basin, California United States. We selected a set of Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) to evaluate historical and projected future trends of streamflow dynamics: rise and fall rates, durations and counts of low and high pulses, and the magnitude of extremes. Results show that most indicators have pronounced departures from baseline conditions under anticipated future climate conditions given existing reservoir operations. For example, the high pulse count decreases during regulated flow conditions compared to increased frequency under unregulated flow conditions. Finally, we observed a higher degree of flow regime alteration due to reservoir operations than climate change. The degree of alteration ranges from 1.0 to 9.0\% across the basin among all future climate scenarios, while reservoir operations alter the flow regime with a degree of alteration from 8.0 to 25\%. This study extends multi-dimensional hydrologic alteration analysis to inform climate adaptation strategies in managed river systems.},

	abstract = {The use of prior information on supply elasticities to calibrate programming models of agricultural supply has been advocated repeatedly in the recent literature (Heckelei and Britz 2005). Yet, Mérel and Bucaram (2009) have shown that the dual goal of calibrating such models to a reference allocation while replicating an exogenous set of supply elasticities is not always feasible. This article lays out the methodological foundation to exactly calibrate programming models of agricultural supply using generalized CES production functions. We formally derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which such models can be calibrated to replicate the reference allocation while displaying crop-specific supply responses that are consistent with prior information. When it exists, the solution to the exact calibration problem is unique. From a microeconomic perspective, the generalized CES model is preferable to quadratic models that have been used extensively in policy analysis since the publication of Howitt’s (1995) Positive Mathematical Programming. The two types of specifications are also compared on the basis of their flexibility towards calibration, and it is shown that, provided myopic calibration is feasible, the generalized CES model can calibrate larger sets of supply elasticities than its quadratic counterpart. Our calibration criterion has relevance both for calibrated positive mathematical programming models and for “well-posed” models estimated through generalized maximum entropy following Heckelei and Wolff (2003), where it is deemed appropriate to include prior information regarding the value of own-price supply elasticities.},

The diagnostic assessment measures the effectiveness, efficiency, reliability, and controllability of ten benchmark MOEAs for a representative suite of water resources applications addressing rainfall–runoff calibration, long-term groundwater monitoring (LTM), and risk-based water supply portfolio planning. The suite of problems encompasses a range of challenging problem properties including (1) many-objective formulations with four or more objectives, (2) multi-modality (or false optima), (3) nonlinearity, (4) discreteness, (5) severe constraints, (6) stochastic objectives, and (7) non-separability (also called epistasis). The applications are representative of the dominant problem classes that have shaped the history of MOEAs in water resources and that will be dominant foci in the future. Recommendations are given for the new algorithms that should serve as the benchmarks for innovations in the water resources literature. The future of MOEAs in water resources needs to emphasize self-adaptive search, new technologies for visualizing tradeoffs, and the next generation of computing technologies.},

Since the 1990s, another approach emerged where water data are incorporated into a macro-economic model, e.g., a computable general equilibrium or input-output model, to estimate both direct and indirect economic impacts. This study builds on these different approaches and compares the outcomes from three models in the transboundary Saskatchewan River Basin in Canada. The economic impacts of drought and socioeconomic development are estimated using an engineering-based model, a macro-economic model, and a model that integrates a water resources model and a macro-economic model. Findings indicate that although the integrated model is more challenging to develop, its results seem most relevant for water allocation, owing to capturing both regional and sectoral economic interdependencies and key features of the water resources system in more detail.},

The study presents an integrated multi-objective simulation-optimization (S-O) framework to evaluate the basin-scale water-environment-agriculture (WEA) nexus. First, the variable-density groundwater model (SEAWAT) is coupled to the reactive transport model (RT3D) for the first attempt to simulate the environmental effects subject to seawater intrusion (SWI) and nitrate pollution (NP). Then, the surrogate assisted multi-objective optimization algorithm is utilized to investigate the trade-offs between the net agricultural benefits and extents of SWI and NP while considering the water supply, food security, and land availability simultaneously. The S-O modeling methodology is applied to the Dagu River Basin (DRB), a typical SWI region with intensive agricultural irrigation in China. It is shown that the three-objective space based on Pareto-optimal front can be achieved by optimizing planting area in the irrigation districts, indicating the optimal evolution of the WEA nexus system. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated by multi-objective S-O model are more realistic and pragmatic, avoiding the decision bias that may often lead to cognitive myopia caused by the low-dimensional objectives. Although the net agricultural benefits in Pareto-optimal solutions are declined to some extent, the environmental objectives (the extents of SWI and NP) are improved compared to those in the pre-optimized scheme. Therefore, the proposed multi-objective S-O framework can be applied to the WEA nexus in the river basin with intensive agriculture development, which is significant to implement the integrated management of water, food, and environment, especially for the semi-arid coastal aquifers.},

	abstract = {The concept of the Water–Energy–Food nexus (WEF), as documented by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), suggests that the three resources are thoroughly interrelated, shaping a complicated web of interlinkages. Perceiving the three commodities as an interdependent variable system, rather than isolated subsystems is a step towards a more holistic approach, and thus a prerequisite to introducing a sustainable scheme for better managing resources. In this work, the well-documented WEF nexus is broadened to a five-dimensional nexus, also involving land use and climate. A methodology for drawing the interrelations among the five dimensions and unreeling the complicated system of direct and indirect interlinkages is given. The intensity of interlinkages among nexus components is initially assessed through a three-point typology with interlinkage scoring corresponding to resource use in Greece. The typology is used and is further expanded to quantify successfully all interlinkages among nexus components with a proposed heuristic algorithm. Results are used to create the cross-interlinkage matrix that identifies food as the most influencing resource and water as the resource mostly influenced by other nexus elements. Results show that indirect interlinkages of multiple resources can be very significant and should not be ignored when planning nexus-coherent policy initiatives and investments in different sectors, in order to promote resource efficiency.},

Optimisation techniques can play an important role in improving the allocation of land to different crops, based on a utility function (such as net revenue) and the water resources needed to support these. Recent work proposed a model formulation for an agricultural region in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area of the Murray-Darling River basin in Australia, and found that the well-known NSGA-II technique could produce sensible crop mixes while preserving ground and surface water for environmental purposes. In the present study we apply Differential Evolution using two different solution representations, one of which explores the restricted space in which no land is left fallow. The results improve on those of the prior NSGA-II and demonstrate that a combination of solution representations allows Differential Evolution to more thoroughly explore the multiobjective space of profit versus environment.},

Different climate change models, based on A2 scenario, were used and the HAD-CM3 model, considering uncertainty, among other climate change models was found to be the best model. For the Dez basin in Iran, considered as a case study, the climate change models predicted increasing temperature from 1.16 to 2.5°C and decreasing precipitation for the future period. Also, runoff volume for the basin would decrease and irrigation demand for the downstream consumption would increase for the future period. A hybrid framework (optimization-climate change) was used for reservoir operation and the bat algorithm was used for minimization of irrigation deficit. A genetic algorithm and a particle swarm algorithm were selected for comparison with the bat algorithm. The reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability indices, based on a multi-criteria model, were used to select the base method for reservoir operation. Results showed the volume of water to be released for the future period, based on all evolutionary algorithms used, was less than for the base period, and the bat algorithm with high-reliability index and low vulnerability index performed better among other evolutionary algorithms.},

	abstract = {Integrated energy-water-land (EWL) planning promotes synergies and avoids conflicts in ways that sector-specific planning approaches cannot. Many important decisions that influence emerging EWL nexus issues are implemented at regional (e.g., large river basin, electricity grid) and sub-regional (e.g., small river basin, irrigation district) scales. However, actual implementation of integrated planning at these scales has been limited. Simply collecting and visualizing data and interconnections across multiple sectors and sub-regions in a single modeling platform is a unique endeavor in many regions. This study introduces and applies a novel approach to linking together multiple sub-regions in a single platform to characterize and visualize EWL resource use, EWL system linkages within and among sub-regions, and the EWL nexus implications of future policies and investments. This integrated planning methodology is applied in the water-stressed Colorado River Basin in Argentina, which is facing increasing demands for agricultural and fossil fuel commodities. Guided by stakeholders, this study seeks to inform basin planning activities by characterizing and visualizing (1) the basin’s current state of EWL resources, (2) the linkages between sectors within and among basin sub-regions, and (3) the EWL nexus implications of planned future agricultural development activities. Results show that water scarcity, driven in part by human demands that have historically reached 60\% of total surface water supply, poses a substantial constraint to economic development in the basin. The Colorado basin has the potential to serve as a testbed for crafting novel and generalizable sub-regional EWL planning approaches capable of informing the EWL planning dialogue globally.},

	abstract = {This study seeks to understand how Argentina's energy, water, and land (EWL) systems will co-evolve under a representative array of human and earth system influences, including socioeconomic change, climate change, and climate policy. To capture Argentina's sub-national EWL dynamics in the context of global change, we couple the Global Change Analysis Model with a suite of consistent, gridded sectoral downscaling models to explore multiple stakeholder-engaged scenarios. Across scenarios, Argentina has the economic opportunity to use its vast land resources to satisfy growing domestic and international demand for crops, such as oil (e.g., soy) and biomass. The human (rather than earth) system produces the most dominant changes in mid-century EWL resource use. A Reference scenario characterized by modest socioeconomic growth projects a 40\% increase in Argentina's agricultural production by 2050 (relative to 2020) by using 50,000 km2 of additional cropland and 40\% more water. A Climate Policy scenario designed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions globally shortly after mid-century projects that Argentina could use 100,000 km2 of additional land (and 65\% more water) to grow biomass and other crops. The burden of navigating these national opportunities and challenges could fall disproportionately on a subset of Argentina's river basins. The Colorado and Negro basins could experience moderate-to-severe water scarcity as they simultaneously navigate substantial irrigated crop demand growth and climate-induced declines in natural water availability. Argentina serves as a generalizable testbed to demonstrate that multi-scale EWL planning challenges can be identified and managed more effectively via integrated analysis of coupled human-earth systems.},

	abstract = {The water-climate-agriculture nexus quantifies synergies, trade-offs, advantages and disadvantages that arise between water management, food production, and climate change consequences taking into account the environmental impacts, economic conditions, and population growth. This work evaluates the water-climate-agriculture nexus in the Gharanghu basin, Iran, seeking to achieve sustainable management of its water system. An optimization model solves for water-release adaptive strategies corresponding to five nexus scenarios to cope with reduced water resources under climate change. The scenarios are as follows (Afshar et al., 2006): change in cropping pattern (Asadieh and Afshar, 2019), reduction of areas under cultivation (Asgari et al., 2015), reuse of agricultural wastewater in irrigated land (Ashofteh et al., 2017), combination of scenarios (Afshar et al., 2006) and (Asgari et al., 2015), namely change in cropping pattern and reuse of agricultural wastewater simultaneously, and (Bates et al., 2008) integration of scenarios (Asadieh and Afshar, 2019) and (Asgari et al., 2015) namely, reduction of areas under cultivation and reuse of agricultural wastewater simultaneously. The nexus scenarios are evaluated with the time reliability index (the ratio of the number of months in which water is supplied to the total months of reservoir operation) based on changes in water supply and agricultural water demand. Results show the time reliability index in the climate change interval (monthly time series for the period 2040–2069) without implementing any nexus scenario equals 28\%, and it increases with the implementation of the water-climate-agriculture nexus scenarios. The time reliability of the system equals 85\% implementing scenario (Bates et al., 2008) (reducing the area under cultivation and reusing agricultural wastewater in irrigated land). The authors' previous research projects that climate change impacts in the study region would be severe. This paper's findings provide water managers and planners with useful strategies for optimal reservoir operation that rely on decreasing water demand and increasing water supply. The approach introduced and applied in this study, which develops modeling adaptation policies to increase the synergies of the water-climate-agriculture nexus, is applicable to other basins.},

The coupled model is capable of performing multiobjective optimization which uses SWMM simulations as a tool to evaluate potential solutions to the optimization problem. The optimization-simulation tool was used to evaluate low impact development (LID) stormwater controls. A SWMM model was developed, calibrated, and validated for a sewershed in Windsor, Ontario and LID stormwater controls were tested for three different return periods. LID implementation strategies were optimized using the optimization-simulation model for five different implementation scenarios for each of the three storm events with the objectives of minimizing peak flow in the stormsewers, reducing total runoff, and minimizing cost.

Changes in climate and society are now introducing additional challenges for controlling these systems, motivating the emergence of complex, integrated simulation models to explore key causal relationships and dependences related to uncontrolled sources of variability. In this brief, we contribute a massively parallel implementation of the evolutionary multiobjective direct policy search method for controlling large-scale water resources systems under uncertainty. The method combines direct policy search with nonlinear approximating networks and a hierarchical parallelization of the Borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. This computational framework successfully identifies control policies that address both the presence of multidimensional tradeoffs and severe uncertainties in the system dynamics and policy performance. We demonstrate the approach on a challenging real-world application, represented by the optimal control of a network of four multipurpose water reservoirs in the Red River basin in Northern Vietnam, under observed and synthetically generated hydrologic conditions. Results show that the reliability of the computational framework in finding near-optimal solutions increases with the number of islands in the adopted hierarchical parallelization scheme. This setting reduces the vulnerabilities of the designed solutions to the system's uncertainty and improves the discovery of robust control policies addressing key system performance tradeoffs.},

	abstract = {Water allocation is facing profound challenges due to climate change uncertainties. To identify adaptive water allocation strategies that are robust to climate change uncertainties, a model framework combining many-objective robust decision making and biophysical modeling is developed for large rivers. The framework was applied to the Pearl River basin (PRB), China where sufficient flow to the delta is required to reduce saltwater intrusion in the dry season. Before identifying and assessing robust water allocation plans for the future, the performance of ten state-of-the-art MOEAs (multi-objective evolutionary algorithms) is evaluated for the water allocation problem in the PRB. The Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA), which is a self-adaptive optimization algorithm, has the best performance during the historical periods. Therefore it is selected to generate new water allocation plans for the future (2079–2099). This study shows that robust decision making using carefully selected MOEAs can help limit saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River Delta. However, the framework could perform poorly due to larger than expected climate change impacts on water availability. Results also show that subjective design choices from the researchers and/or water managers could potentially affect the ability of the model framework, and cause the most robust water allocation plans to fail under future climate change. Developing robust allocation plans in a river basin suffering from increasing water shortage requires the researchers and water managers to well characterize future climate change of the study regions and vulnerabilities of their tools.},

	abstract = {In recent years, uncertainties in climate change have made the allocation of waste load a severe challenge. This research develops a new model framework integrating a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) for hydrological simulation of the river basin, Borg many-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA) for optimization, and a software for many-objective robust decision making (OpenMORDM) to minimize these uncertainties and identifying the most robust waste load allocation plans resisting the impact of system uncertainties. This framework has been applied to the Golgol River basin, Iran, which is the main source of the Ilam dam water supply. In this study, first, temperature and precipitation were predicted in 2080–2099. Then, The SWAT model was used to simulate runoff and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Afterward, by specifying the objective functions, the Borg MOEA produced the most optimal waste load allocation scenarios in the driest month of the future (August), So that the amount of BOD in the dam reservoir remains less than 5 mg/L. In the next step, the robustness of the solutions analyzed using OpenMORDM. Then, the results were analyzed using the patient rule induction method (PRIM) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods to identify the system vulnerability domains and minimizing false positives. Through the analysis, four climate scenarios have been used to explain how the methodological selection of them affects the resulting candidate planning solutions. The results indicated that individual design selections from the water managers or researchers could influence the efficacy of the model framework, which in turn results in failure of the most robust waste-load allocation strategies under future climate change.},

Traditionally, the EOPF problem only quantified tradeoffs between fuel costs and emissions. This traditional formulation is limiting because it requires analysts to specify numerous constraints before optimization which can be especially problematic if system limits are uncertain or flexible. By considering these constraints as objectives, solutions can be optimized over a larger decision space, and lower cost/emissions can be traded off with potentially small constraint violations. We apply our formulation to the IEEE 30-bus system and use the Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to analyze tradeoffs between objectives. We show that this formulation allows grid operators to apply adjusted constraints after the multi-objective design procedure, thus allowing for greater insights into system performance and further justification of system constraints.},

	abstract = {A considerable fraction of urban water supply capacity serves primarily as a hedge against drought. Water utilities can reduce their dependence on firm capacity and forestall the development of new supplies using short-term drought management actions, such as conservation and transfers. Nevertheless, new supplies will often be needed, especially as demands rise due to population growth and economic development. Planning decisions regarding when and how to integrate new supply projects are fundamentally shaped by the way in which short-term adaptive drought management strategies are employed. To date, the challenges posed by long-term infrastructure sequencing and adaptive short-term drought management are treated independently, neglecting important feedbacks between planning and management actions. This work contributes a risk-based framework that uses continuously updating risk-of-failure (ROF) triggers to capture the feedbacks between short-term drought management actions (e.g., conservation and water transfers) and the selection and sequencing of a set of regional supply infrastructure options over the long term. Probabilistic regional water supply pathways are discovered for four water utilities in the “Research Triangle” region of North Carolina. Furthermore, this study distinguishes the status-quo planning path of independent action (encompassing utility-specific conservation and new supply infrastructure only) from two cooperative formulations: “weak” cooperation, which combines utility-specific conservation and infrastructure development with regional transfers, and “strong” cooperation, which also includes jointly developed regional infrastructure to support transfers. Results suggest that strong cooperation aids utilities in meeting their individual objectives at substantially lower costs and with less overall development. These benefits demonstrate how an adaptive, rule-based decision framework can coordinate integrated solutions that would not be identified using more traditional optimization methods.},

	abstract = {Cooperative management of natural resources is a key component of a transition to a sustainable society and urban water supply planning is a prime example. Regional cooperation among urban water utilities is a powerful mechanism for improving supply reliability and financial stability in urban water supply systems. Through coordinated drought mitigation and joint infrastructure investment, water utilities can efficiently exploit existing water supplies and reduce or delay the need for new supply infrastructure. However, cooperative water management brings new challenges for planning and implementation. The benefits of cooperation may not be uniformly distributed across cooperating partners, resulting in the “instability” of cooperative compromises. Further, cooperation may add new vulnerabilities for each partner by imbuing their cooperating partners with the power to impact their performance through policy actions. Power imbalances stemming from these vulnerabilities can lead to conflict between cooperating partners that destabilize otherwise robust planning alternatives. This work contributes a new exploratory modeling centered framework for assessing cooperative stability and mapping power relationships in cooperative infrastructure investment and water supply management policies. Our framework uses multi-objective optimization as an exploratory tool to discover how cooperating partners may be incentivized to defect from robust regional water supply partnerships and identifies how the actions of each regional partner shape the vulnerability of its cooperating partners. Our methodology is demonstrated on the Sedento Valley, a highly challenging hypothetical regional urban water supply benchmarking problem. Our results reveal complex regional power relationships between the region's cooperating partners and suggest ways to improve cooperative stability.},

The concerted occurrence of climate change, human hostilities, poverty increase in several countries and a pandemic outbreak have all contributed to the global challenge of food insecurity. Sustainable management of the three essential resources requires a paradigm shift from a singular and separate approach where each of the resources is independently treated to a multi-dimensional approach that recognises the interconnectedness of the resources, referred to as the Food-energy-water-nexus (FEW-N). A critical and holistic study of optimum interconnections in the FEW-N within social, environmental and economic framework is required. The paper leverages on multi-objective sustainable land use allocation models, integrated with energy and water resource allocation challenges in the food sector, taking cognisance of the FEW-N. Result validation was carried out under different scenarios within the South African context. The results demonstrate the robustness of the developed optimisation framework in introducing optimality amongst multiple objectives while exploring the trade-offs amidst competitions.

	abstract = {Increasing scarcity and pollution has called for changes in water policies, which should reflect society's preferences toward water use, development, and the environment. Water management is still limited in incorporating changing policies and in deriving directives to implement water instruments under long-term planning. Some examples are water charges that do not reflect watershed externalities and water permits lacking future vision of allocation. Hydro-economic modeling has explored trade-offs of water allocation and improved water operations but still does not address instruments' integration. This paper proposes a modeling approach that identifies how to apply water management instruments integrated with each other to deliver a water allocation strategy reconciled with economic development projections and changing water use preferences. This improves our understanding on adjusting the implementation of water management instruments considering future outcomes and trade-offs. The methodology combines discrete dynamic programming to determine increments in water permits, multiobjective linear programming to generate a Pareto set to model users' water preferences, and nonlinear programming to allocate water permits over different river reaches subject to water quality targets. The reconciliation allowed to identify sustainable water allocation strategies supported by a watershed, and instruments' integration to make it feasible. Strategies imposing limited water permits to economic users and watershed regions indicated where (and when) water conservation programs should be applied, along with quantitative targets (how much). The economic trade-offs identified reference values for economic instruments to compensate the externalities. Finally, less strict water quality targets did not result in higher economic returns.},

This paper develops a multi-model ensemble framework encompassing 5 mathematical programming models (2 Positive Mathematical Programming models, 2 Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming models and 1 Weighted Goal Programming model) that represent the observed behavior of socioeconomic agents to: 1) simulate the impacts of the Piedmontese water pricing reform on land use allocation and management, water conservation, profit and water tariff revenue; 2) sample modeling uncertainty through the ensemble spread; and 3) explore potential tipping points through use of scenario-discovery techniques. Our research suggests that the key challenge to the reform lies in the management of rice fields, an extensive (17\% of the agricultural area), water-demanding and relatively low-added-value crop that nonetheless delivers significant ecosystem services (e.g. water retention) of historical and cultural relevance to the region. The ensemble experiment suggests that rice agriculture rapidly dwindles in the price range 0.012–0.074 EUR/m3 depending on the model. Before reaching this tipping point, agricultural water pricing can reduce withdrawals up to 1.7\%–9.5\%, while reducing profit between 4.9\% and 5.6\% and achieving a 57- to 65-fold increase in water tariff revenue.},

Today, however, the enormous increase in water consumption associated with pistachio production has severely depleted groundwater aquifers, causing widespread water shortages in the region. In this article, we develop a comprehensive system dynamics model, combining the agronomic, economic, hydrologic, and behavioral aspects to analyze the long-term implications of pistachio production. Our research contributes to the literature of agricultural water management in three significant ways: (i) it provides a validated and quantitative model exploring pistachio farming for a region; (ii) it explicitly captures behavioral decision rules associated with orchard growth and production investment; and (iii) it addresses a natural common-pool-resources problem with very long-time horizons. We consider several policies aimed at addressing the problem (e.g. water transfers, drip irrigation, financial subsidies, income tax, water pricing, and land purchasing). Our results suggest that policies that increase the effectiveness and efficiency of production (e.g. water transfer and drip irrigation respectively), albeit preferred by farmers, lead to better-before-worse results, depleting groundwater storage in the long term.

	abstract = {A common environmental externality of groundwater pumping is streamflow depletion. To manage impacts of groundwater pumping on hydrologically connected surface water systems, regulators often impose quotas, or allocations, limiting the rates of groundwater extraction. Allocations vary in their temporal flexibility, ranging from single-year “hard caps” to multi-year “soft caps”. Soft cap allocations allow greater flexibility for farmers, the primary users of groundwater, to adjust irrigation rates from one year to another, potentially providing greater resilience to drought but also altering hydrologic impacts of pumping. In this study, we integrate agronomic, economic, and hydrologic models to evaluate optimal irrigation decisions for a range of equivalent hard and soft cap limits, and assess trade-offs between the resulting economic (farm profitability) and hydrologic (stream depletion) outcomes. Soft cap allocation policies consistently outperform equivalent hard caps in terms of greater farm profitability and reduced production risks. However, the economic benefits of soft caps come at the cost of higher peak and cumulative rates of streamflow depletion, with the magnitude of differences dependent on aquifer properties, well location, and the length of the soft cap allocation period. Our findings suggest that the optimal allocation design will depend on competing socioeconomic and environmental objectives, and, in some instances, may require a blended approach to efficiently achieve desired management goals.},

This research contributes to the literature on groundwater management by developing a hydro-economic farm optimization model that allows us to internalize the environmental externalities associated with groundwater extraction and compare outcomes with various levels of uniform proportional cuts to agricultural groundwater extraction rights. Our case studies are three sub-areas within Western Australia’s most important groundwater system: the Gnangara Groundwater System. We find evidence that: (i) once environmental externalities are accounted for, the optimal water use by horticulture falls by between 26\% and 38\% across the three sub-areas; and (ii) compared to a uniform proportional cut policy, spatially and temporally flexible policy mechanisms achieve higher environmental gain with a lower cost to horticulture},

This study presents an agent-based framework to study the interaction among agricultural, environmental, and regulator agents within an agricultural system. The behavior of the agricultural sector was simulated at two levels: agricultural sub-agents, and agricultural group-agents. For agricultural sub-agents, individual benefit was maximized under behavioral and physical constraints simulated by a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and mathematical programing. A coupled linear optimization and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) were adopted to identify the best solution, from the agricultural sector’s viewpoint. The proposed framework was implemented in the Najaf Abad hydrological unit, situated in Isfahan province, central Iran, considering fixed and stepwise penalty approaches. Sensitivity analysis of the amount of base penalty in the fixed penalty scenario indicated that, under a \$0.12 per cubic meter penalty, the annual over-exploitation declined from the current 79 million cubic meters (MCM) to zero. Furthermore, the results indicated that if the width of the step increased from 1 to 9 MCM/year9 MCM/year{\textbackslash}textlessmath display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmrow{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmn{\textbackslash}textgreater9{\textbackslash}textless/mn{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmtext{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textless/mtext{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmi{\textbackslash}textgreaterMCM{\textbackslash}textless/mi{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmo stretchy="false"{\textbackslash}textgreater/{\textbackslash}textless/mo{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmi{\textbackslash}textgreateryear{\textbackslash}textless/mi{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/mrow{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/math{\textbackslash}textgreater, the over-exploitation increased by about 18 MCM/year18 MCM/year{\textbackslash}textlessmath display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmrow{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmn{\textbackslash}textgreater18{\textbackslash}textless/mn{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmtext{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textless/mtext{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmi{\textbackslash}textgreaterMCM{\textbackslash}textless/mi{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmo stretchy="false"{\textbackslash}textgreater/{\textbackslash}textless/mo{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessmi{\textbackslash}textgreateryear{\textbackslash}textless/mi{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/mrow{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/math{\textbackslash}textgreater.},

	abstract = {It is imperative to understand the interconnectedness of water use and hydrological impacts for water policy design underlying varying hydrological conditions across space and over time. However, such analysis remains difficult, constrained by the lack of appropriate modeling tools that fully integrate water policies, water use, and hydrological processes with high spatiotemporal resolutions. To address this challenge, this study proposes a distributed policy design scheme featuring spatially variable and temporally dynamic policies for conjunctive surface water-groundwater management in large river basins. A fully integrated modeling framework is developed to tightly couple (a) an agent-based model for farmers' water use under distributed water policies and (b) a physically based hydrological model for surface water-groundwater processes. The modeling framework is applied to the Heihe River Basin to assess water use and hydrological impacts under distributed water policies. By using the distributed policy scheme to adjust a water policy (e.g., groundwater tax) across space and over time, we found that hydrological outcomes can be improved without adversely reducing agricultural water supply. For example, by shifting the implementation of a high groundwater tax from dry to wet years, a rise of the water table by 0.28 m (0.03–0.95 m across different irrigation districts) can be achieved while the total water supply is maintained at a similar level. Furthermore, hydrological externality effects among nearby districts can be explicitly identified and quantified based on assessments of spatially varying water policies. This study highlights the need for water policy design to consider spatiotemporal variations in the physical hydrological system.},

	abstract = {Aquifers supply water to millions of farms, thousands of cities, and billions of people worldwide. Water use and economic activity in aquifer-dependent regions cannot be sustained if groundwater levels are not stabilized. This article addresses a question relevant to these regions internationally: how can water scarce areas reduce aquifer depletion while supporting the many economically and institutionally important uses of groundwater, which serve as a critical source of supply in many parts of the world with limited or seasonal precipitation which could become more pronounced in the face of future climate stress. Facing that challenge, this work presents a framework for discovering measures to hydrologically stabilize aquifers that control economic losses while respecting local institutional constraints. It advances our capacity to discover measures to efficiently, equitably, and sustainably allocate burden sharing that protects aquifers while adapting to hydrologic, economic, and institutional characteristics of an affected community. Results of this work show that for the aquifers investigated, present practices of groundwater use are unsustainable and finds that alternative practices are possible. It provides scenarios describing such practices and also determines their hydrological and economic consequences. Finally, it shows how these results can feed into policy debates over the several water-sharing arrangements. This work makes several incremental contributions: calibrating modelled pumping patterns to the historical baseline, controlling economic costs of achieving hydrologic sustainability, respecting institutional constraints governing equitable burden sharing, presenting an approach with powers of generalizability, and using routinely collected data. While the approach and findings are illustrated for two aquifers in Africa, its approach carries some generalizability. All data, variables, equations, constraints, and results are included as appendices.},

	abstract = {When performed without technical criteria, the rapid expansion of irrigated agricultural frontiers can result in overexploitation of water, causing worrying impacts on the balance of agroecosystems. This study proposes a model applied to the state of Bahia, to estimate the water demand of areas irrigated by a central pivot, in order to contribute to information that will subsidize the inspection and planning of water resources in the promotion of sustainable agriculture. The irrigated areas were identified and measured by photointerpretation using orbital images from the Landsat-8 satellite. With a historical series of data, the reference evapotranspiration was calculated and monthly water balance was elaborated. The data obtained were spatialized by kriging, and with punctual values of water deficit (mm), the water demand of the irrigated perimeter of the equipment was estimated. The results were described considering strategic planning units, proposed from municipalities, hydrographic basins and biomes. A total of 4075 pivots were quantified, covering an irrigated area of 265,896.30 ha and with an average annual consumption of 1,333,473,208.02 m3 of water. Areas of high demand were identified, especially in the western region of Bahia, which includes the hydrographic basin of the São Francisco River and the Cerrado biome, concentrating 80.85\% and 75.47\% of the state water demand for pivots, respectively. Considering possible points of water vulnerability and continuity of this expansion, the results provide the primary information needed to encourage the adoption of public policies aimed at the management of water resources. The study method proposes guidelines that condition the application in any region of interest in the world.},

The result is a database of simulations representing multiple plausible futures which offers information on uncertainty regarding scenario assumptions and model structure (through the ensemble spread). Using an iterative robust decision-making framework, simulation results are coupled with experts’ knowledge and opinion to detect vulnerabilities in the proposed strategies, quantify potential trade-offs between responses, and identify a robust adaptation strategy. Methods are illustrated as applied to the Órbigo Catchment in Northwestern Spain, where the Douro River Basin Authority (DRBA) will decide in the coming months whether to build two dams to enhance irrigation water supply and reliability. Simulation results show that, for most scenarios and models considered, dam construction costs lead to water prices beyond the willingness of local cereal-growing irrigators to pay. Following a robust decision-making process, parties to the decision unanimously declared the status quo (i.e., no dam construction) strategy to be preferred to the dam construction strategy. This outcome substantiates the need for economic assessments of dam construction projects that account for nonlinear responses by agents to complement technical assessments in decision making.},

Most river basin authorities still base decision-making on inputs from hydrologic Decision Support Systems (DSS), and have limited information on the economic costs that water policies may impose on the economy. This paper presents a time-variant hierarchical framework that connects a hydrologic module and an economic module by means of two-way feedback protocols. The hydrologic module is designed to fit the AQUATOOL DSS, the hydrologic model used by Spanish river basin authorities to inform decision-making at a basin scale; while the economic module is populated with a Positive Multi-Attribute Mathematical Programming (PMAMP) model that represents the behavior and adaptive responses of irrigators. The proposed hierarchical framework is used to assess the economic repercussions of strengthening irrigation quotas so to achieve minimum environmental flows in the Douro River Basin (Spain) under climate change. Results show that reductions in agricultural water allocations to meet environmental flow requirements create nonlinear incremental profit and employment losses in irrigated agriculture that are on average low to moderate (between −4\% and −12.9 \% for profit, and between −4.6 \% and −12 \% for employment, depending on the scenario). During extreme droughts, the abrupt reductions in water availability and agricultural allocations can test farming systems past the breaking point and lead to catastrophic profit and employment losses ({\textbackslash}textgreater80 \%).},

	abstract = {Complex human–water systems are deeply uncertain. Policymakers are not aware of all possible futures (deep uncertainty type 2), while the probability of those futures that can be identified ex-ante is typically unknown (deep uncertainty type 1). In this context, standard decision-making based on a complete probabilistic description of future conditions and optimization of expected performance is no longer appropriate; instead, priority should be given to robustness, through the identification of policies that are (i) insensitive to foreseeable changes in future conditions (classical robustness that addresses deep uncertainty type 1) and (ii) adaptive to unforeseen contingencies (adaptive robustness that addresses deep uncertainty type 2). This research surveys recent advances in (socio-)hydrology and (institutional) economics toward robust decision-making. Despite significant progress, integration among disciplines remains weak and allows only for a fractioned understanding and partial representation of uncertainty. To bridge this gap, I will argue that science needs to further underpin the development and integration of two pieces of ex-ante information: (1) a modeling hierarchy of human–water systems to assess policy performance under alternative scenarios and model settings, so as to navigate deep uncertainty type 1 and (2) a longitudinal accounting and analysis of public transaction costs to navigate deep uncertainty type 2.},

However, some consumptive uses of water are more or less flexible than others, depending on the costs or effects associated with their curtailment. Here, we estimate the share of global water consumption over the period 1980–2016 from the relatively inflexible demands of irrigating perennial crops, cooling thermal power plants, storing water in reservoirs and supplying basic water for humans and livestock. We then construct a water stress index that integrates the share of runoff being consumed (scarcity), the share of consumption in these inflexible categories (flexibility) and the historical variability of runoff weighted by storage capacity (variability), and use our index to evaluate the trends in water stress of global major river basins on six continents. We find that the 10\% most stressed basins encompass {\textbackslash}textasciitilde19\%, 19\% and 35\% of global population, thermal electricity generation and irrigated calorie production, respectively, and some of these basins also experience the largest increases in our identified stress indexes over the study period. Water consumption intensities (water used per unit of goods or service produced) vary by orders of magnitude across and within continents, with highly stressed basins in some cases characterized by high water consumption intensities. Our results thus point to targeted water mitigation opportunities (for example, relocating crops and switching cooling technologies) for highly stressed basins.},

We investigated how adaptations related to FEW vulnerabilities are occurring and what the global community can learn about the interactions across these adaptations. We conducted a global analysis of a data set derived from scientific literature to present the first large scale assessment (n = 1,204) of evidence-based FEW-related climate adaptations. We found that the most frequently reported adaptations to FEW vulnerabilities by continent occurred in Africa (n = 495) and Asia (n = 492). Adaptations targeting food security were more robustly documented than those relevant to water and energy security, suggesting a greater global demand to address food security. Determining statistically significant associations, we found a network of connections between variables characterizing FEW-related adaptations and showed interconnectedness between a variety of natural hazards, exposures, sectors, actors, cross-cutting topics and geographic locations. Connectivity was found between the vulnerabilities food security, water, community sustainability, and response to sea level rise across cities, settlements, and key infrastructure sectors. Additionally, generalized linear regression models revealed potential synergies and tradeoffs among FEW adaptations, such as a necessity to synergistically adapt systems to protect food and water security and tradeoffs when simultaneously addressing exposures of consumption and production vs. poverty. Results from qualitative thematic coding showcased that adaptations documented as targeting multiple exposures are still limited in considering interconnectivity of systems and applying a nexus approach in their responses. These results suggest that adopting a nexus approach to future FEW-related adaptations can have profound benefits in the management of scarce resources and with financial constraints.},

	abstract = {Water availability is a major factor constraining humanity's ability to meet the future food and energy needs of a growing and increasingly affluent human population. Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the “food-energy-water nexus.” The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food-energy-water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.},

	abstract = {The areas of energy, water and food policy have numerous interwoven concerns ranging from ensuring access to services, to environmental impacts to price volatility. These issues manifest in very different ways in each of the three “spheres”, but often the impacts are closely related. Identifying these interrelationships a priori is of great importance to help target synergies and avoid potential tensions. Systems thinking is required to address such a wide swath of possible topics. This paper briefly describes some of the linkages at a high-level of aggregation – primarily from a developing country perspective – and via case studies, to arrive at some promising directions for addressing the nexus. To that end, we also present the attributes of a modelling framework that specifically addresses the nexus, and can thus serve to inform more effective national policies and regulations. While environmental issues are normally the ‘cohesive principle’ from which the three areas are considered jointly, the enormous inequalities arising from a lack of access suggest that economic and security-related issues may be stronger motivators of change. Finally, consideration of the complex interactions will require new institutional capacity both in industrialised and developing countries.},

	abstract = {Agroecosystems represent 38 \% of global land use. Agroecosystems are located close to human settlements and are managed to produce food and fibers, traded in markets. Agroecosystems also produce other goods and services essential to human beings, such as climate regulation, flood mitigation, and landscape amenity. Economists and ecologists have developed the ecosystem services framework to foster the provision of these non-commercial services. Scientists can therefore help decision makers to develop sustainable ecosystems by studying ecosystem services. Here, we analyze the trade-offs of ecosystem services of farming systems. We discuss case studies of mixed perennial crops. The set of ecosystem services provided by these agroecosystems depends on their composition, structure, and management. Complex rule-based management will be required if winegrowers are to maintain an adequate set of ecosystem services across contrasting climatic years. Innovations including cover crops in banana systems can fulfill most of the objective set but will rely on increased farm labor. We then discuss the advantages, challenges, and opportunities to include the description of relations between ecosystem services in cropping system design. We propose to extend the yield gap analysis to ecosystem services, as a service gap analysis. This extension faces methodological questions about the potential provision of a service in a region. We conclude on the challenges that need to be faced if we want to use ecosystem services trade-offs to improve the contribution of agricultural systems to human well-being.},

Here we provide a global overview of groundwater depletion (here defined as abstraction in excess of recharge) by assessing groundwater recharge with a global hydrological model and subtracting estimates of groundwater abstraction.

Here we quantify globally the amount of nonrenewable or nonsustainable groundwater abstraction to sustain current irrigation practice. We use the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB to simulate gross crop water demand for irrigated crops and available blue and green water to meet this demand. We downscale country statistics of groundwater abstraction by considering the part of net total water demand that cannot be met by surface freshwater. We subsequently confront these with simulated groundwater recharge, including return flow from irrigation to estimate nonrenewable groundwater abstraction. Results show that nonrenewable groundwater abstraction contributes approximately 20\% to the global gross irrigation water demand for the year 2000. The contribution of nonrenewable groundwater abstraction to irrigation is largest in India (68 km3 yr−1) followed by Pakistan (35 km3 yr−1), the United States (30 km3 yr−1), Iran (20 km3 yr−1), China (20 km3 yr−1), Mexico (10 km3 yr−1), and Saudi Arabia (10 km3 yr−1).

This reflects the often poorly understood impacts of climate change, the hidden nature of groundwater and the general neglect of groundwater management. Many developing countries are highly reliant on groundwater. Given expectations of reduced supply in many regions and growing demand, pressure on groundwater resources is set to escalate. This is a crucial problem and demands urgent action. This report addresses the impacts of climate change on groundwater and adaptation options. The Earth's climate is projected to become warmer and more variable. Increased global temperatures are projected to affect the hydrologic cycle, leading to changes in precipitation patterns and increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme events; reduced snow cover and widespread melting of ice; rising sea levels; and changes in soil moisture, runoff and groundwater recharge. Increased evaporation and the risk of flooding and drought could adversely affect security of water supply, particularly surface water. Due to these pressures, as well as global population growth, demand for groundwater is likely to increase.},

A changing climate, marked by more frequent and intense hydrologic extremes, poses threats to groundwater recharge and amplifies groundwater use. However, widespread human development and contamination of groundwater reservoirs pose an immediate threat of resource extinction with impacts in many regions with dense population or intensive agriculture. A rapid increase in global groundwater studies has emerged, but this has also highlighted the extreme paucity of data for substantive trend analyses and assessment of the state of the global resource. Noting the difficulty in seeing and measuring this typically invisible resource, we discuss factors that determine the current state of global groundwater, including the uncertainties accompanying data and modeling, with an eye to identifying emerging issues and the prospects for informing local to global resource management in critical regions. We comment on some prospective management strategies.},

It is therefore important to quantify the spatiotemporal interactions between groundwater and climate. However, current understanding of the global-scale sensitivity of groundwater systems to climate change3,4—as well as the resulting variation in feedbacks from groundwater to the climate system5,6—is limited. Here, using groundwater model results in combination with hydrologic data sets, we examine the dynamic timescales of groundwater system responses to climate change. We show that nearly half of global groundwater fluxes could equilibrate with recharge variations due to climate change on human ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde100 year) timescales, and that areas where water tables are most sensitive to changes in recharge are also those that have the longest groundwater response times. In particular, groundwater fluxes in arid regions are shown to be less responsive to climate variability than in humid regions. Adaptation strategies must therefore account for the hydraulic memory of groundwater systems, which can buffer climate change impacts on water resources in many regions, but may also lead to a long, but initially hidden, legacy of anthropogenic and climatic impacts on river flows and groundwater-dependent ecosystems.},

Research on the economic benefits associated with groundwater resources has typically focused on the impacts of groundwater availability on the profitability of agricultural production or on the non-market benefits associated with groundwater quality for human consumption. In this research, we use stated-preference methods to investigate the total economic value to agricultural producers of an increase in groundwater availability in the Ogallala Aquifer region. The contingent valuation method allows for estimation of values beyond agricultural profitability, including non-market values such as the ability to leave additional groundwater to future generations. We find a median willingness to pay (WTP) for an additional 100 gallons per minute of well capacity of \$77 per well, and that this estimate depends strongly on current well capacity and climate conditions. For counties in hotter and drier regions of the aquifer with low well capacity, median WTP is significantly higher. These results are then used in conjunction with projections of future climate and groundwater availability to generate predicted changes in the WTP for additional groundwater across the aquifer. This research provides important feedback on how the benefits of additional groundwater availability are predicted to change as groundwater resources are diminished in a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Millions of Californians access drinking water via domestic wells, which are vulnerable to drought and unsustainable groundwater management. Groundwater overdraft and the possibility of longer drought duration under climate change threatens domestic well reliability, yet we lack tools to assess the impact of such events. Here, we leverage 943 469 well completion reports and 20 years of groundwater elevation data to develop a spatially-explicit domestic well failure model covering California’s Central Valley. Our model successfully reproduces the spatial distribution of observed domestic well failures during the severe 2012–2016 drought (n = 2027). Next, the impact of longer drought duration (5–8 years) on domestic well failure is evaluated, indicating that if the 2012–2016 drought would have continued into a 6 to 8 year long drought, a total of 4037–5460 to 6538–8056 wells would fail. The same drought duration scenarios with an intervening wet winter in 2017 lead to an average of 498 and 738 fewer well failures. Additionally, we map vulnerable wells at high failure risk and find that they align with clusters of predicted well failures. Lastly, we evaluate how the timing and implementation of different projected groundwater management regimes impact groundwater levels and thus domestic well failure. When historic overdraft persists until 2040, domestic well failures range from 5966 to 10 466 (depending on the historic period considered). When sustainability is achieved progressively between 2020 and 2040, well failures range from 3677 to 6943, and from 1516 to 2513 when groundwater is not allowed to decline after 2020.},

The most common are (1) basin or sub-basin scale volumetric allocations, usually based on either historic use or estimates of recharge, (2) trigger-level management which regulates use according to observations of groundwater level, and (3) buffer zones, which control the location of wells, particularly around groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs). The volumetric approach limits the long-term impact of abstraction and provides a stable, secure supply for groundwater users. However, this approach does not consider the spatial distribution of recharge and discharge, and so is poor at protecting GDEs. Buffer zones provide an effective means of limiting the short-term impact of abstraction on GDEs, and can also be used to shift impact from high to low priority GDEs. However, buffer zones mostly delay the impacts of abstraction on groundwater level and flow, and are less effective for managing long-term impacts. Groundwater response triggers aim to directly control groundwater levels, although the success of this approach is highly dependent on the location of the observation well, and the trigger value. This makes its successful implementation extremely difficult. Used alone, none of these approaches will successfully protect the environment. In combination, they can provide reasonable protection for ecosystems and reliability of groundwater supply for users.},

We then use the well records to estimate the percentage of wells that were dry during the years 2013–2015. During the two year period, dry wells were concentrated in rural areas with high agricultural productivity, such as parts of the California Central Valley and the High Plains. Our results support anecdotal evidence that wells used for domestic purposes are more susceptible to drying than wells used for agricultural purposes throughout California’s Central Valley because the former tend to be shallower. However, this is not the case in all regions. Our findings suggest that declining groundwater levels are threatening drinking water reliability and agricultural productivity, and consequently, have key implications for both domestic and agricultural water security. Ongoing reductions to groundwater storage are drying groundwater wells in the western US, and this manifestation of water scarcity warrants innovative groundwater management transcending status quos.},

The spaceborne monitoring of LS is the more prevalent technique ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde 38\% of total cases) compared to the ground-investigation (e.g. geological surveying, leveling, GPS, and modeling). Human-induced LS cases are 76.92\% of all the LS cases around the world and groundwater extraction contributes 59.75\% of these cases. Strong direct correlations with the exponential trend are observed between the average LS rate (LSavg) with groundwater withdrawal (R2 = 0.950) and groundwater level decline (R2 = 0.888). To understand the influential factors on LS occurrences, the relationship of LS rate with climate factors, hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer, human-induced factors are investigated. Finally, we provide future research guidelines and implications that need to be expanded in order to better monitor and reduce the impact of the LS phenomenon. The outcomes of this study can be used to derive a framework helpful for interpreting the observed LS phenomena and for forecasting future situations to mitigate or control this geohazard.},

	abstract = {Population growth, economic development, and dietary changes have drastically increased the demand for food and water. The resulting expansion of irrigated agriculture into semi-arid areas with limited precipitation and surface water has greatly increased the dependence of irrigated crops on groundwater withdrawal. Also, the increasing number of people living in mega-cities without access to clean surface water or piped drinking water has drastically increased urban groundwater use. The result of these trends has been the steady increase of the use of non-renewable groundwater resources and associated high rates of aquifer depletion around the globe. We present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in research on non-renewable groundwater use and groundwater depletion. We start with a section defining the concepts of non-renewable groundwater, fossil groundwater and groundwater depletion and place these concepts in a hydrogeological perspective. We pay particular attention to the interaction between groundwater withdrawal, recharge and surface water which is critical to understanding sustainable groundwater withdrawal. We provide an overview of methods that have been used to estimate groundwater depletion, followed by an extensive review of global and regional depletion estimates, the adverse impacts of groundwater depletion and the hydroeconomics of groundwater use. We end this review with an outlook for future research based on main research gaps and challenges identified. This review shows that both the estimates of current depletion rates and the future availability of non-renewable groundwater are highly uncertain and that considerable data and research challenges need to be overcome if we hope to reduce this uncertainty in the near future.},

	abstract = {Water is a precious natural resource which is severely stressed in many parts of the world. Semi-arid regions across the globe experience less rainfall and high evapotranspiration rates. Because water scarcity is a major concern in many semi-arid regions owing to the absence of perennial sources of water, available water resources must be managed. The main reasons for water scarcity are significant water demand and deficient regional recharges. Groundwater is a reliable source of water in arid and semi-arid regions, and it is widely consumed for irrigation, domestic and industrial uses. There is a link between the social and technical aspects of groundwater management. Research has shown that this source of water has profound social and economic benefits across the world. Exhaustive groundwater abstraction has led to aquifer overexploitation and, consequently, resulted in a lowering of the water table at an alarming rate. Currently groundwater in key aquifers is being rapidly depleted and aquifers are being degraded. The degradation is caused mainly by the disposal of human and industrial wastes and the percolation of pesticides and herbicides. This chapter discusses the various issues and challenges of groundwater and surface water management in semi-arid regions.},

This comparative study examines the interrelationships between ocean-atmosphere teleconnections, groundwater levels and precipitation in coastal aquifers of California (USA) and Portugal. Piezometric and climate indices (1989–2019) are analyzed using singular spectral analysis and wavelet transform methods. Singular spectral analysis identifies signals consistent with the six dominant climate patterns: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific/North American Oscillation (PNA) in California, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Eastern Atlantic Oscillation (EA) and the Scandinavian Pattern (SCAND) in Portugal. Lower-frequency oscillations have a greater influence on hydrologic patterns, with PDO (52.75\%) and NAO (46.25\%) on average accounting for the largest amount of groundwater level variability. Wavelet coherences show nonstationary covariability between climate patterns and groundwater levels in distinct period bands: 4–8 years for PDO, 2–4 years for ENSO, 1–2 years for PNA, 5–8 years for NAO, 2–4 years for EA and 2–8 years for SCAND. Wavelet coherence patterns also show that coupled climate patterns (NAO+ EA– and paired PDO and ENSO phases) are associated with major drought periods in both the Mediterranean climate zones.},

	abstract = {Irrigation is the most important water use sector accounting for about 70\% of the global freshwater withdrawals and 90\% of consumptive water uses. While the extent of irrigation and related water uses are reported in statistical databases or estimated by model simulations, information on the source of irrigation water is scarce and very scattered. Here we present a new global inventory on the extent of areas irrigated with groundwater, surface water or non-conventional sources, and we determine the related consumptive water uses. The inventory provides data for 15 038 national and sub-national administrative units. Irrigated area was provided by census-based statistics from international and national organizations. A global model was then applied to simulate consumptive water uses for irrigation by water source. Globally, area equipped for irrigation is currently about 301 million ha of which 38\% are equipped for irrigation with groundwater. Total consumptive groundwater use for irrigation is estimated as 545 km3 yr−1, or 43\% of the total consumptive irrigation water use of 1277 km3 yr−1. The countries with the largest extent of areas equipped for irrigation with groundwater, in absolute terms, are India (39 million ha), China (19 million ha) and the USA (17 million ha). Groundwater use in irrigation is increasing both in absolute terms and in percentage of total irrigation, leading in places to concentrations of users exploiting groundwater storage at rates above groundwater recharge. Despite the uncertainties associated with statistical data available to track patterns and growth of groundwater use for irrigation, the inventory presented here is a major step towards a more informed assessment of agricultural water use and its consequences for the global water cycle.},

Instead, multiple plausible futures need to be considered, which requires (i) uncertainties to be described with the aid of scenarios that represent coherent future pathways based on different sets of assumptions, (ii) system performance to be represented by metrics that measure insensitivity (i.e. robustness) to changes in future conditions, and (iii) adaptive strategies to be considered alongside their more commonly used static counterparts. However, while these factors have been considered in isolation previously, there has been a lack of discussion of the way they are connected.

	abstract = {As the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus becomes an increasingly common framework for bridging science and policy, there is a growing need to unpack and make explicit many of the methods and assumptions being used to operationalize the nexus. In this paper, we focus on two common approaches to nexus research, quantitative modeling and futures thinking, and the ways that each set of methodological tools address uncertainty. We first review the underlying assumptions of each approach with a focus on sources of and ability to measure uncertainty, and potential complementarities. Quantitative modeling takes a probabilistic approach to predicting the likelihood of a specific outcome or future state based on estimates of current system dynamics. In contrast, futures thinking approaches, such as scenario processes, explore novel changes that cannot be fully predicted or even anticipated based on current understandings of the nexus. We then examine a set of applied nexus projects that bridge science and policy-making contexts to better understand practitioner experiences with different methodological tools and how they are utilized to navigate uncertainty. We explore one nexus case study, LIVES Cambodia, in-depth, to better understand the opportunities and challenges associated with participatory modeling and stakeholder engagement with uncertainty in a policy-making context. Across the cases, practitioners identify the complementarity between modeling and futures thinking approaches, and those projects that integrated both into the planning process experienced benefits from having multiple angles on uncertainty within the nexus. In particular, stakeholder engagement provided critical opportunities to address some types of uncertainties (e.g., data gaps) through the use of local knowledge. Explicit discussions of model uncertainty and use of scenario processes also enabled stakeholders to deepen their understandings of uncertainties and envision policy pathways that would be robust to uncertainty. In many senses, models became boundary objects that encouraged critical thinking and questioning of assumptions across diverse stakeholders. And, for some nexus projects, confronting uncertainty in explicit and transparent ways build capacity for policy flexibility and adaptiveness. We conclude with a discussion of when and how these benefits can be fully realized through the strategic use of appropriate approaches to characterizing and navigating nexus uncertainty.},

Studies pertaining to calculations of flows and dependencies between different resources, assessments of technology and policy applications, and quantifications of system performance have been conducted to understand their interlinkages and develop management options. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review on the concepts, research questions and methodologies in the field of water-energy-food. First, two types of nexus definition are compared and discussed to understand the nature of nexus research issues. Then, nexus research questions are summarized into three themes: internal relationship analysis, external impact analysis, and nexus system evaluation. Eight nexus modelling approaches are discussed in terms of their advantages, disadvantages and applications, and guidance is provided on the selection of an appropriate modelling approach. Finally, future research challenges are identified, including system boundary, data uncertainty and modelling, underlying mechanism of nexus issues and system performance evaluation. This review helps bring research efforts together to address the challenging questions in the nexus research and develop sustainable and resilient water, energy and food systems.},

The use of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods in an integrated assessment (IA) framework offers a far better alternative to cost/benefit and similar methods. To facilitate understanding of MCDM methods, we offer a typology for this broad class of models, suggest some of the types of problems that may be analyzed with these methods, and recommend the implementation of several MCDM methods in currently evolving IA frameworks. Depending upon the choice of method from this family of methods, a wide range of attributes associated with multi-pollutant reduction and energy system development strategies, and a diversity of stakeholder preferences may be incorporated into the analysis. The resulting policy space can then provide a basis for comparison and selection of policy alternatives in a political or negotiated process.},

	abstract = {Increased natural and anthropogenic stresses have threatened the Earth's ability to meet growing human demands of food, energy and water (FEW) in a sustainable way. Although much progress has been made in the provision of individual component of FEW, it remains unknown whether there is an optimized strategy to balance the FEW nexus as a whole, reduce air and water pollution, and mitigate climate change on national and global scales. Increasing FEW conflicts in the agroecosystems make it an urgent need to improve our understanding and quantification of how to balance resource investment and enhance resource use efficiencies in the FEW nexus. Therefore, we propose an integrated modeling system of the FEW nexus by coupling an ecosystem model, an economic model, and a regional climate model, aiming to mimic the interactions and feedbacks within the ecosystem–human–climate systems. The trade-offs between FEW benefit and economic cost in excess resource usage, environmental degradation, and climate consequences will be quantitatively assessed, which will serve as sustainability indicators for agricultural systems (including crop production, livestock and aquaculture). We anticipate that the development and implementation of such an integrated modeling platform across world's regions could build capabilities in understanding the agriculture-centered FEW nexus and guiding policy and land management decision making for a sustainable future.},

Failing to recognize these responses overstates the risks confronting producers and understates their ability to respond to adverse circumstances. Dynamic programming (DP) provides a means for determining optimal long-term crop management plans. However, most applications in the literature base their analysis on annual time steps with fixed strategies within the year, effectively ignoring conditional responses during the year. We suggest an alternative approach that captures the strategic responses within a cropping season to random weather variables as they unfold, reflecting farmers’ ability to adapt to weather realizations. We illustrate our approach by applying it to a typical cereal farm in Karak, Jordan. The results show that including conditional within-year responses to weather reduces the frequency of fallowing by 23\% and increases expected income by 9\%.},

	abstract = {Increasing demand for water coupled with reduced water availability in many regions of the world is leading to growing water scarcity and calls for implementation of a range of technological, institutional, and economic solutions. Water-economy models (WEMs), which integrate the complex interrelationships between hydrologic and economic systems, are effective tools for analyzing these issues and for providing appropriate solutions across varied spatial and temporal scales. These models can be powerful tools for examining potential future changes in water resources systems, including the effects of climate change, socioeconomic changes, and infrastructural and policy responses to water resource management challenges. In this paper, the WEM models used to answer water economy questions are classified into two general categories on the basis of their structure: network-based (simulation or optimization) hydroeconomic models, and economywide (input-output or computable general equilibrium) models. This paper highlights the primary differences in the applications and interpretations obtained using these approaches, analyzes the distribution of questions that different WEMs have been used to answer, and discusses previous work and efforts to integrate across model types. Findings suggest that additional efforts are needed to more realistically account for the range and complexity of linking water systems and society, particularly regarding ecology and water quality, and the food and energy sectors. Additionally, the broader economic impacts of water-related processes, for example those related to interregional trade dynamics, the distribution of income, and migration, should be investigated further. In effect, because of the inherent complexity in the economic dynamics underlying many water systems, such tools can challenge intuition and provide critical insights that are relevant to more effective management of transboundary water resources and related sectors.},

	abstract = {Considering the essence of economic orientation in agricultural water management, this study proposes a practical framework for i) determining agricultural water price scenarios, ii) addressing the economic, social, and environmental effects resulting from imposing the scenarios, and iii) operating systems performance appraisal for implementing the scenarios. Accordingly, the framework constitutes interrelated components of economic, hydraulic/operational, and multicriteria decision-making models. The first component of the framework is the Positive Mathematical Programming, which intends to determine water price scenarios and assess the scenarios' inter-sectoral economic, social, and environmental impacts. The hydraulic/Operational Model, the second component, is coupled with the economic model to investigate how successful the water distribution systems' economic policy in the status quo. The third component is an operational model that provides a real-time and automatic water distribution configuration, using a centralized Model Predictive Controller. The automatic system deals with the adoption of dynamic water prices as a free-market-oriented economic policy. The last component, the multicriteria decision-making model, provides the possibility of water price scenarios ranking based on sustainability. The proposed framework was implemented in a real test case, Rudasht Irrigation district, located in Iran's arid region. The results indicate that the “economic value of water” got the first rank based on the sustainable water management criteria between the possible price scenarios. The results indicate that the status quo's water distribution system showed unreliable water distribution performance under the entire water price scenarios, based on the water distribution adequacy and equity indicators. However, reliable and fairly water distribution between the stakeholders, located upstream to the district's downstream regions, is provided by the automatic control system in the water price scenarios. The results indicate that employing the robust operating system led to −59\% of water overused and −15\% of the energy consumption, as the environmental benefits, in the best pricing scenario.},

Decision-making context, consideration of climate change, scenarios or management measures were also examined. Results showed that the critical conceptual system dynamics model development phases are often neglected with only 40\% of reviewed articles developing causal loop diagrams, and only three studies identifying system archetypes. Most reviewed publications applied scenario-based approaches (82\%) to evaluate the effectiveness of management measures, whilst a minority of studies (1.8\%) considered water management optimisation. Structure behaviour and behaviour-pattern tests (52\%) were mostly applied to evaluate the validity of the model structure and accuracy of the behaviour's pattern, though model validation was not conducted in 12\% of the studies. Finally, an integrated system dynamics modelling framework was proposed, exploring opportunities for integration of system dynamics with other modelling tools based on the strengths and limitations of system dynamics modelling; this framework can be used to enhance the simulation and optimisation for future water resource management and planning in the context of climate change and socio-economic development.},

	abstract = {With increasing exploitation of groundwater resources, integrated assessment of aquifers is an essential step to maintain aquifers’ sustainability. The DPSIR-GOF (Drivers, pressures, states, impacts, responses-Goal oriented framework) combined approach is used in this study to conceptualize and identify various factors affecting the Najafabad aquifer system in Iran. Neither DPSIR nor GOF frameworks, when used separately, can consider a specific prioritization for the solutions and the proposed scenarios nor can provide a comprehensive view of the system from the past to the future. Therefore, the unique combination of the DPSIR and GOF frameworks in this study is used to conceptualize and evaluate the aquifer system from the past to the future, considering the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainable development. To implement this combined approach hydrological data (groundwater level, evaporation rate, precipitation rate, temperature rate, etc.) and economic and social data (population rate, employment status, income level, literacy level, etc.) were used. After identifying the links and dimensions of the DPSIR-GOF framework, some scenarios are proposed to improve the aquifer’s state. Furthermore, evaluation indicators including technical indicators (aquifer sustainability and dryness) and economic indicators (productivity and cost-benefit analysis) are used to determine the performance of management scenarios and prioritize their effectiveness in restoring and sustaining the aquifer. Finally, the scenarios of 5\% (R1) and 10\% (R2) reduction in groundwater exploitation, as well as 10\% (C1) and 20\% (C2) reduction of cultivated area were introduced. Results show that a decrease in exploitations over 30 years effectively maintained the aquifer balance in all four scenarios. Scenario R2, with crop per drop, benefit per drop, and CBA of 1.62, 9.3, and 0.39, respectively, was preferred to other scenarios during the 30 years of the simulation period. Based on a 41-year sustainability index, scenario R2 performed better in reducing the impact of drought than other scenarios. Sources of uncertainties involved in this study were hydrological data including aquifer inputs and outputs, agricultural costs and crop production based on region's inflation rate. The findings can help decision-makers and managers choose the most appropriate approach and policy to obtain sustainable groundwater resource systems and maintain economic and social security.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, there has been an increasing demand for water, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas of Iran, resulting in excessive use of waters, more specifically groundwater resources. The present study aims at optimizing the use of groundwater and determining the optimal pumping rate (OPR) of wells in an appropriate manner. First, a hydrodynamic groundwater model, known as MODFLOW, was developed, calibrated, and verified. Subsequently, the model was linked to a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), and the objective functions were defined as the maximization of net benefit from agricultural products and minimization of the groundwater table drawdown, using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm version II (NSGA-II). Then, the optimal policies were derived considering three scenarios of water and power consumption management (NEXUS) in terms of base price, 50\% reduction, and 50\% increase in the base price. The replacement of a 50\% reduction in costs scenario with the status quo showed an increase of up to 10\% in the benefits gained from agricultural crops and, consequently, a 16\% increase in groundwater table drawdown. On the other hand, the scenario of a 50\% increase in costs resulted in a 10\% reduction in benefits and a 51\% increase in the groundwater level. There is a positive correlation between electricity prices and the sustainability of aquifers. Nevertheless, it led to economic instability caused by the loss of farmers’ income. To follow the Subsidy Reform Plan (SRP), subsidy to agricultural products was recommended to be provided as an optimal policy to ensure sustainable groundwater withdrawal and food security.},

Using a unique spatial data set of groundwater users in western Kansas, we are able to empirically measure the physical and behavioral effects of groundwater pumping by neighbors. To address the simultaneity of neighbors' pumping, we use the neighbors' permitted water allocation as an instrument for their pumping. We estimate that 2.5\% of the total groundwater extracted each year in western Kansas is over-extraction due to the effects of spatial externalities. Individuals who own multiple wells internalize their own externality by trading off pumping at one well for pumping at another.},

The modelling framework presented integrates climate, economic, agronomic and hydrological scenarios to design a programme of adaptation measures at the river basin scale. Future demand scenarios, combined with a down-scaled climate scenario, provide the basis to estimate the demand and water resources in 2030. A least-cost river basin optimisation model is then applied to select adaptation measures ensuring that environmental and supply management goals are achieved. In the Orb river basin (France), the least-cost portfolio selected suggests mixing demand and supply side measures to adapt to global change. Trade-offs among the cost of the programme of measures, the deficit in agricultural water supply and the level of environmental flows are investigated. The challenges to implement such interdisciplinary approaches in the definition of adaptation strategies are finally discussed.},

The objective of this study is to model groundwater dynamics to depletion under different economic policies and climate change by using a system dynamics approach. For this purpose a dynamic hydro-economic model which simultaneously simulates the farmer’s economic behavior, groundwater aquifer dynamics, studied area climatology factors and government economical policies related to groundwater, is developed using STELLA 10.0.6. The vulnerability of groundwater balance is forecasted under three scenarios of climate including the Dry, Nor and Wet and also, different scenarios of irrigation water and energy pricing policies. Results show that implementation of some economic policies on irrigation water and energy pricing can significantly affect on groundwater exploitation and its volume balance. By increasing of irrigation water price along with energy price, exploitation of groundwater will improve, in so far as in scenarios S15 and S16, studied area’s aquifer groundwater balance is positive at the end of planning horizon, even in Dry condition of precipitation. Also, results indicate that climate change can affect groundwater recharge. It can generally be expected that increases in precipitation would produce greater aquifer recharge rates.},

The framework determined the economically optimal level of water use on different soil types and in different management regimes and estimated impact of seawater intrusion and waterlogging on net revenue of growing sugarcane in two neighbouring water board areas (North Burdekin Water Board – NBWB and South Burdekin Water Board – SBWB). In NBWB, the predicted aggregate net revenue was highest (\$19.95 million) when groundwater use was also highest (70\%) while predicted aggregate net revenue was lowest when groundwater use was also lowest. In SBWB, the predicted aggregate net revenue was highest (\$23 million) when groundwater use was relatively low (61\%).

	abstract = {Groundwater overdraft occurs when extraction exceeds both natural and induced aquifer recharge over long periods. While ultimately unsustainable and invariably having detrimental effects, overdrafting aquifers is common and may be temporarily beneficial within a long-term water management strategy. Once a region chooses to end overdrafting, water management must change if increased water scarcity is to be avoided. Integrated water-management models allow aquifers and overdraft to be analyzed as part of a regional water-supply system. Incorporating economics into the model establishes a framework for evaluating the costs and effects of groundwater management actions on the entire system. This economic-engineering approach is applied in a case study of the Tulare Basin in California, USA, where previous economic studies showed optimal pumping depths have been reached. A hydro-economic optimization model is used to study the economic effects and water management actions that accompany ending overdraft. Results show that when overdraft is prohibited, groundwater banking using conjunctive-use infrastructure built between 1990 and 2005 largely annuls the cost of not overdrafting. The integrated economic-engineering approach quantifies effects of groundwater policies on complex regional water-resource systems and suggests promising strategies for reducing the economic costs of ending aquifer overexploitation.},

	abstract = {Measures to protect irrigation water supplies for food security continue to receive international attention to address growing water scarcity when faced by increased food demands combined with reduced water supply reliability. Yet, a common problem where water is delivered with earthen canals is delivery inefficiency combined with low economic values per unit of water. In many of the world's arid regions, climate stressed water shortages have raised the importance of discovering measures to improve irrigation delivery efficiency. However, little research grade work to date has presented an integrated analysis of the economic performance of irrigation delivery improvements faced by drought and climate stressed regions. This paper's unique contribution is to investigate the economic performance of water conservation infrastructure combined with dynamically optimized use of saved water. We develop a state-of-the arts empirical dynamic optimization model to discover land and water use patterns that optimize sustained farm income. Results from the upper watershed irrigation region of the Canadian Basin in the southwestern US show that canal and delivery system lining can raise the sustained economic value of water for crop irrigation. The saved water can see immediate use in dry years. It can also be stored in wet years to mitigate the most adverse impacts of future climate water stress. This double dividend is especially important in rain-fed watersheds for which surface water supplies for irrigation are difficult to forecast accurately. Findings light a path for water managers and other stakeholders who bear responsibility of finding economically responsible measures to improve irrigation water productivity in the world's dry regions.},

The coupling occurs in a sequential fashion using bidirectional protocols that represent the feedback responses between the microeconomic and hydrologic modules through common spatial elements and variables. The proposed model is illustrated with an application to agricultural water management in the Upper Tagus River Basin in Spain. The non-linear responses observed in the modeled human-water system suggest that strengthening the agricultural water allocation constraint can avert or delay drought negative environmental impacts with a less-than-proportional yet incremental impact on Gross Value Added and employment.},

A five-step procedure is presented in order to elicit the utility function that reproduces farmers׳ current decision-making. We illustrate this positive multi-attribute approach using a sample of farmers in an irrigated area in southern Spain, where our simulations demonstrate the accurateness of the model in reproducing actual farmers׳ decision-making.

	abstract = {The Piedmont Region in NW Italy has recently deployed an ambitious and pioneering agricultural water pricing reform aimed at integrating and effectively enforcing EU's Water Framework Directive principles of cost recovery, polluter-pays and affordability. This paper develops a multi-model ensemble framework encompassing 5 mathematical programming models (2 Positive Mathematical Programming models, 2 Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming models and 1 Weighted Goal Programming model) that represent the observed behavior of socioeconomic agents to: 1) simulate the impacts of the Piedmontese water pricing reform on land use allocation and management, water conservation, profit and water tariff revenue; 2) sample modeling uncertainty through the ensemble spread; and 3) explore potential tipping points through use of scenario-discovery techniques. Our research suggests that the key challenge to the reform lies in the management of rice fields, an extensive (17\% of the agricultural area), water-demanding and relatively low-added-value crop that nonetheless delivers significant ecosystem services (e.g. water retention) of historical and cultural relevance to the region. The ensemble experiment suggests that rice agriculture rapidly dwindles in the price range 0.012–0.074 EUR/m3 depending on the model. Before reaching this tipping point, agricultural water pricing can reduce withdrawals up to 1.7\%–9.5\%, while reducing profit between 4.9\% and 5.6\% and achieving a 57- to 65-fold increase in water tariff revenue.},

It explores approaches and tools supporting the design of strategic plans under deep uncertainty, and their testing in the real world, including barriers and enablers for their use in practice. The book broadens traditional approaches and tools to include the analysis of actors and networks related to the problem at hand. It also shows how lessons learned in the application process can be used to improve the approaches and tools used in the design process. The book offers guidance in identifying and applying appropriate approaches and tools to design plans, as well as advice on implementing these plans in the real world. For decisionmakers and practitioners, the book includes realistic examples and practical guidelines that should help them understand what decisionmaking under deep uncertainty is and how it may be of assistance to them. Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty: From Theory to Practice is divided into four parts. Part I presents five approaches for designing strategic plans under deep uncertainty: Robust Decision Making, Dynamic Adaptive Planning, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways, Info-Gap Decision Theory, and Engineering Options Analysis. Each approach is worked out in terms of its theoretical foundations, methodological steps to follow when using the approach, latest methodological insights, and challenges for improvement. In Part II, applications of each of these approaches are presented. Based on recent case studies, the practical implications of applying each approach are discussed in depth. Part III focuses on using the approaches and tools in real-world contexts, based on insights from real-world cases. Part IV contains conclusions and a synthesis of the lessons that can be drawn for designing, applying, and implementing strategic plans under deep uncertainty, as well as recommendations for future work. The publication of this book has been funded by the Radboud University, the RAND Corporation, Delft University of Technology, and Deltares. ; Offers a comprehensive examination of the approaches and tools for designing plans under deep uncertainty and their application Identifies barriers and enablers for the use of the various approaches and tools in practice Includes realistic examples and practical guidelines to help readers better understand the concepts},

Despite the breadth of information to support adaptation planning however, knowledge is fragmented, obscuring information needs, hampering strategic planning and constraining decision-making capacities. In this letter, we present and apply the Adaptation Knowledge Cycle (AKC), a heuristic for rapidly evaluating and systematising adaptation research by analytical foci: Impacts, Implications, Decisions or Actions. We demonstrate its application through an assessment of ten years’ climate change adaptation research for New Zealand’s primary industries. The letter draws on the results of systematic review, empirical analysis, workshops, interviews, narrative analyses and pathways planning to synthesise information and identify knowledge gaps. Results show the heuristic’s simplicity is valuable for cross- and transdisciplinary communication on adaptation in New Zealand’s primary industries. Results also provide insight into what we know and need to know with respect to undertaking adaptation planning. With the development of tools and processes to inform decision making under conditions of uncertainty—such as adaptation pathways—it is increasingly important to efficiently and accurately determine knowledge needs. The combination of systematic data collection techniques, and heuristics such as the AKC may provide researchers and stakeholders with an efficient, robust tool to review and synthesise existing knowledge, and identify emerging research priorities. Results can in turn support the design of targeted research and inform adaptation strategies for policy and practice.},

To assess the efficacy of these three methods, we compare them using three different policy formulations of the lake problem: inter-temporal, planned adaptive, and direct policy search. The more robustness is considered in the search phase, the more robust solutions are also after re-evaluation but also the lower the performance in individual reference scenarios. Adaptive policy formulations positively affect robustness, but do not reduce the price for robustness. Multi-scenario MORDM strikes a pragmatic balance between robustness considerations and optimality in individual scenarios, at reasonable computational costs.},

	abstract = {Coordinated and efficient operation of water resource systems becomes essential to deal with growing demands and uncertain resources in water-stressed regions. System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization–simulation–optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

	abstract = {Groundwater is a critical input to agricultural production across the globe. Current groundwater pumping rates frequently exceed recharge, often by a substantial amount, leading to groundwater depletion and potential declines in agricultural profits over time. As a result, many regions reliant on irrigated agriculture have proposed policies to manage groundwater use. Even when gains from aquifer management exist, there is little information about how policies affect individual producers sharing the resource. In this paper, we investigate the variability of groundwater management policy impacts across heterogeneous agricultural producers. To measure these impacts, we develop a hydroeconomic model that captures the important role of well capacity, productivity of water, and weather uncertainty. We use the model to simulate the impacts of groundwater management policies on producers in the High Plains aquifer of eastern Colorado and compare outcomes to a no-policy baseline. The management policies considered include a pumping fee, a quantity restriction, and an irrigated acreage fee. We find that well capacity and soil type affect policy impacts but in ways that can qualitatively differ across policy type. Model results have important implications for the distributional impacts and political acceptability of groundwater management policies.},

This study compares the performance of a groundwater market with water quotas when assumptions of perfect information are violated due to climate change and hydrogeologic heterogeneity and explores how changes in future climate affect market performance. A subbasin of the Republican River Basin, overlying the Ogallala aquifer in the High Plains of the United States, is used as a case study. Building on a previously developed model, a multiagent system model simulating a groundwater market is developed where self-interested agents can trade water use permits to maximize individual benefits subject to irrigation and land constraints. This economic model is coupled with a calibrated physically based groundwater model for the study region that allows for an evaluation of streamflow depletion impacts, which has been the focus of management efforts in the basin. Results show that trading of permits between farmers results in increased economic benefits and, in some cases, reduced environmental violations. However, the benefits of a groundwater market are distributed unequally resulting in “winners” and “losers” across the system. Future changes in climate are shown to significantly influence farmers willingness to pay for groundwater and thus increase the variation in groundwater price and pumping. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing hydroclimatologic variability and change in the design of groundwater markets.},

In the United States, recent awareness of this externality has led to intra- and inter-state conflict and rapidly-changing water management policies and institutions. Although the marginal damage of groundwater use on stream flows depends crucially on the location of pumping relative to streams, current regulations are generally uniform over space. We use a population data set of irrigation wells in the Nebraska portion of the Republican River Basin to analyze whether adopting spatially differentiated groundwater pumping regulations leads to significant reductions in farmer abatement costs and costs from damage to streams. We find that regulators can generate most of the potential savings in total social costs without accounting for spatial heterogeneity. However, if regulators need to increase the protection of streams significantly from current levels, spatially differentiated policies will yield sizable cost savings.},

Results suggest that the benefits to different types of users as well as the sustainability of the CPR vary by the regulator's choice of management institution. More specifically, quota-based management and CPR status-based management institutions can lead to increased benefits to CPR beneficiaries, prolong the CPR's life, and prevent “tragedy of the commons.” In contrast, tax-based management institutions may fail to secure sustainable use of the CPRs. Bankruptcy-based management institutions may also be used toward sustainable use of the CPRs and to increase the benefits to the users; however, their overall effectiveness is not as desirable as the quota-based and resource status-based management institutions, especially when enforcing social justice is an issue of concern for the regulator.},

	abstract = {Developing robust policies for complex systems is a profound challenge because of their nonlinear and unpredictable nature. Dealing with these characteristics requires innovative approaches. A possible approach is to design policies that can be adapted over time in response to how the future unfolds. An essential part of adaptive policymaking is specifying under what conditions, and in which way, to adapt the policy. The performance of an adaptive policy is critically dependent on this: if the policy is adapted too late or too early, significant deterioration in policy performance can be incurred. An additional complicating factor is that in almost any policy problem, a multiplicity of divergent and potentially conflicting objectives has to be considered. In this paper we tackle both problems simultaneously through the use of multi-objective robust simulation optimization. Robust optimization helps in specifying appropriate conditions for adapting a policy, by identifying conditions that produce satisfactory results across a large ensemble of scenarios. Multi-objective optimization helps in identifying such conditions for a set of criteria, and providing insights into the tradeoffs between these criteria. Simulation is used for evaluating policy performance. This approach results in the identification of multiple alternative conditions under which to adapt a policy, rather than a single set of conditions. This creates the possibility of an informed policy debate on trade-offs. The approach is illustrated through a case study on designing a robust policy for supporting the transition toward renewable energy systems in the European Union. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be efficiently used for developing policy suggestions and for improving decision support for policymakers. By extension, it is possible to apply this methodology in dynamically complex and deeply uncertain systems such as public health, financial systems, transportation, and housing.},

However, uncertainty in various forms challenges inferences from modeling results. Model-based support for decision-making has increasingly adopted an emerging exploratory approach. This approach addresses uncertainty explicitly through systematically exploring the implications of modeling assumptions, aiming to enhance the robustness of inferences from models. Despite a variety of applications, the extent and the way(s) that exploratory modeling can deal with the challenges that arise from the uncertainty and complexity of decision-making with stakeholders has not yet been systematically framed. We address this gap in two ways. First, we present a taxonomy of the ways that exploratory modeling can be used to inform robust inferences in coupled human-natural systems by mapping the technical capabilities of this approach in relation to the diversity of past applications. This subsequently guides an investigation of the practical benefits and challenges of these capabilities in handling uncertainty and complexity. Second, we discuss different ways for integrating genuine stakeholder engagement into exploratory modeling through transdisciplinary research. Finally we outline some priorities for future expansion of this research area.},

	abstract = {Most common methods used in optimal control of reservoir systems require a large number of control variables, which are typically the sequences of releases from all reservoirs and for all time steps of the control period. In contrast, the less widespread parameterization-simulation-optimization (PSO) method is a low-dimensional method. It uses a handful of control variables, which are parameters of a simple rule that is valid through the entire control period and determines the releases from different reservoirs at each time step. The parameterization of the rule is linked to simulation of the reservoir system, which enables the calculation of a performance measure of the system for given parameter values, and nonlinear optimization, which enables determination of the optimal parameter values. To evaluate the PSO method and, particularly, to investigate whether the radical reduction of the number of control variables might lead to inferior solutions or not, we compare it to two alternative methods. These methods, namely, the high-dimensional perfect foresight method and the simplified “equivalent reservoir” method that merges the reservoir system into a single hypothetical reservoir, determine “benchmark” performance measures for the comparison. The comparison is done both theoretically and by investigation of the results of the PSO against the benchmark methods in a large variety of test problems. Forty-one test problems for a hypothetical system of two reservoirs are constructed and solved for comparison. These refer to different objectives (maximization of reliable yield, minimization of cost, maximization of energy production), water uses (irrigation, water supply, energy production), characteristics of the reservoir system and hydrological scenarios. The investigation shows that PSO yields solutions that are not inferior to those of the benchmark methods and, simultaneously, it has several theoretical, computational, and practical advantages.},

Development of the institutional arrangements necessary to manage changing demands and supplies is in its infancy. Design criteria for the development of a set of institutional arrangements for the robust management of scarce water resources is offered and then used to develop a generic framework for the allocation and use of water. Variations to account for differences in ground, regulated and unregulated water resources are offered. The question of how best to sequence reform of existing water entitlement and allocation regimes is also addressed. The result is a recommendation for the use of water sharing plans to determine how much water may be used at any point in time and an unbundled suite of arrangements that enable efficient but separated management of long term and short term considerations and, also, the control of externalities. System-wide adjustment is facilitated through the periodic revision of water sharing plans. Individual adjustment to changing circumstances is facilitated through trade in entitlements and allocations. Before the introduction of institutional arrangements that encourage adjustment through trade it is recommended that the abstraction regime used be converted into one that accounts for return flows and allocates water according to shareholder entitlement. Seniority, beneficial-use criteria and opportunities to third parties to prevent adjustment according to pre-specified rules should be repealed. Well-designed regimes can be extended to include dam-capacity shares and allow the use of market-based instruments in delivery of water-quality objectives. Pooling can be used to lower the costs of risk management.},

	abstract = {Water management usually considers economic and ecological objectives, and involves tradeoffs, conflicts, compromise, and cooperation among objectives. Pareto optimality often is championed in water management, but its relationships with the mathematical representation of objectives, and implications of tradeoffs for Pareto optimal decisions, are rarely examined. We evaluate the mathematical properties of optimized tradeoffs to identify promising regions for compromise, suggest strategies for reducing conflicts, and better understand whether decision-makers are more or less likely to cooperate on environmental water allocations. Cooperation and compromise among objectives can be easier when tradeoff curves are concave and more adversarial when tradeoff curves are convex. “Knees,” or areas with maximum curvature, bulges, or breakpoints in concave Pareto frontiers, suggest more promising areas for compromise. Evaluating the shape of Pareto curves based on each objective's performance function can screen for the existence of knees amenable to compromise. We explore water management and restorations actions that improve and shift the location and prominence of knees in concave Pareto frontiers. Connecting river habitats and other non-flow management actions may add knees on locally concave regions of Pareto frontiers. Managing multiple streams regionally, rather than individually, can sometimes turn convex local tradeoffs into concave regional tradeoffs more amenable to compromise. Overall, this analysis provides a deep investigation of how the shape of tradeoffs influences the range and promise of decisions to improve performance, and illustrates that management actions may encourage cooperation and reduce conflict.},

	abstract = {A new sequential data assimilation method is discussed. It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations. The proposed method can therefore be used with realistic nonlinear ocean models on large domains on existing computers, and it is also well suited for parallel computers and clusters of workstations where each processor integrates a few members of the ensemble.},

A simulation platform that captures these complex elements can be used to inform policy and best management practices to promote sustainable agriculture. We have developed a tightly coupled framework using the macroscale variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrologic model and the CropSyst agricultural model. A mechanistic irrigation module was also developed for inclusion in this framework. Because VIC–CropSyst combines two widely used and mechanistic models (for crop phenology, growth, management, and macroscale hydrology), it can provide realistic and hydrologically consistent simulations of water availability, crop water requirements for irrigation, and agricultural productivity for both irrigated and dryland systems. This allows VIC–CropSyst to provide managers and decision makers with reliable information on regional water stresses and their impacts on food production. Additionally, VIC–CropSyst is being used in conjunction with socioeconomic models, river system models, and atmospheric models to simulate feedback processes between regional water availability, agricultural water management decisions, and land–atmosphere interactions. The performance of VIC–CropSyst was evaluated on both regional (over the US Pacific Northwest) and point scales. Point-scale evaluation involved using two flux tower sites located in agricultural fields in the US (Nebraska and Illinois). The agreement between recorded and simulated evapotranspiration (ET), applied irrigation water, soil moisture, leaf area index (LAI), and yield indicated that, although the model is intended to work on regional scales, it also captures field-scale processes in agricultural areas.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

We also describe and demonstrate the use of systematic calibration checks at different stages for efﬁcient debugging of models. The central model is the California Statewide Agricultural Production Model (SWAP), a Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) model of California irrigated agriculture. We outline the six step calibration procedure and demonstrate the model with an empirical policy analysis. Two new techniques are included compared with most previous PMP-based models: exponential PMP cost functions and Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) regional production functions. We then demonstrate the use of this type of disaggregated production model for policy analysis by evaluating potential water transfers under drought conditions. The analysis links regional production functions with a water supply network. The results show that a more ﬂexible water market allocation can reduce revenue losses from drought up to 30\%. These results highlight the potential of self-calibrated models in policy analysis. While the empirical application is for a California agricultural and environmental water system, the approach is general and applicable to many other situations and locations.},

	abstract = {Multireservoir systems are designed to serve multiple conflicting demands over varying time scales that may be out of phase with the system's hydroclimatic inputs. Adaptive, nonlinear reservoir control policies are often best suited to serve these needs. However, nonlinear operating policies are hard to interpret, so water managers tend to favor simple, static rules that may not effectively manage conflicts between the system's multisectoral demands. In this study, we introduce an analytical framework for opening the black box of optimized nonlinear operating policies, decomposing their time-varying information sensitivities to show how their adaptive and coordinated release prescriptions better manage hydrologic variability. Interestingly, these information sensitivities vary significantly across policies depending on how they negotiate tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. We illustrate this analysis in the Red River basin of Vietnam, where four major reservoirs serve to protect the capital of Hanoi from flooding while also providing the surrounding region with electric power and meeting multisectoral water demands for the agricultural and urban economies. Utilizing Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search, we are able to design policies that, using the same information as sequential if/then/else-based operating guidelines developed by the government, outperform these traditional rules with respect to every objective. Policy diagnostics using time-varying sensitivity analysis illustrate how the Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search operations better adapt and coordinate information use to reduce food-energy-water conflicts in the basin. These findings accentuate the benefits of transitioning to dynamic operating policies in order to manage evolving hydroclimatic variability and socioeconomic demands in multipurpose reservoir networks.},

This article shows that negative entropy is a signiﬁcant ﬂaw when entropy is used as a sensitivity measure in global sensitivity analysis. Global sensitivity analysis based on differential entropy cannot have negative entropy, just as Sobol sensitivity analysis does not have negative variance. Entropy is similar to variance but does not have the same properties. An alternative sensitivity measure based on the approximation of the differential entropy using dome-shaped functionals with non-negative values is proposed in the article. Case studies have shown that new sensitivity measures lead to a rational structure of sensitivity indices with a signiﬁcantly lower proportion of higher-order sensitivity indices compared to other types of distributional sensitivity analysis. In terms of the concept of sensitivity analysis, a decrease in variance to zero means a transition from the differential to discrete entropy. The form of this transition is an open question, which can be studied using other scientiﬁc disciplines. The search for new functionals for distributional sensitivity analysis is not closed, and other suitable sensitivity measures may be found.},

For parameter prioritization, we consider variance-based sensitivity measures, sensitivity indices based on the L1-norm, the Kuiper metric, and the sensitivity indices of the DELSA methods. For trend identification, we investigate insights derived from graphing the one-way ANOVA sensitivity functions, the recently introduced CUSUNORO plots, and derivative scatterplots. For interaction quantification, we consider information delivered by variance-based sensitivity indices. We rely on the so-called given-data principle, in which results from a set of model runs are used to perform a defined set of analyses. One avoids using specific designs for each insight, thus controlling the computational burden. The methodology is applied to a hydrological model of a river in Belgium simulated using the well-established Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) on five alternative configurations. The findings show that the integration of the chosen methods provides insights unavailable in most other analyses.},

In this paper, the widely-used variance-based method (Sobol') and the recently proposed momentindependent PAWN method for GSA are applied to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and compared in terms of ranking and screening results of 26 SWAT parameters. In order to set a threshold for parameter screening, we propose the use of a “dummy parameter”, which has no inﬂuence on the model output. The sensitivity index of the dummy parameter is calculated from sampled data, without changing the model equations. We ﬁnd that Sobol' and PAWN identify the same 12 inﬂuential parameters but rank them differently, and discuss how this result may be related to the limitations of the Sobol' method when the output distribution is asymmetric.},

Recently, a more efficient single-loop procedure has been introduced, and consistency of this procedure has been demonstrated separately for particular measures, such as those based on variance, density, and information value. In this work, we give a unified proof of single-loop consistency that applies to any measure satisfying a common rationale. This proof is not only more general but invokes less restrictive assumptions than heretofore in the literature, allowing for the presence of correlations among model inputs and of categorical variables. We examine numerical convergence of such an estimator under a variety of sensitivity measures. We also examine its application to a published medical case study.},

This work introduces a design for estimating global sensitivity indices from given data (including simulation input–output data), at the minimum computational cost. We address the problem starting with a statistic based on the L1norm. A formal deﬁnition of the estimators is provided and corresponding consistency theorems are proved. The determination of conﬁdence intervals through a bias-reducing bootstrap estimator is investigated. The strategy is applied in the identiﬁcation of the key drivers of uncertainty for the complex computer code developed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) assessing the risk of lunar space missions.

However, this cost-benefit approach may not guarantee robustness under uncertain future conditions, for instance under climatic changes. In this paper, we expand risk-based decision analysis to explore possible ways of enhancing robustness in engineered water resources systems under different risk attitudes. Risk is measured as the expected annual cost of water use restrictions, while robustness is interpreted in the decision-theoretic sense as the ability of a water resource system to maintain performance—expressed as a tolerable risk of water use restrictions—under a wide range of possible future conditions. Linking risk attitudes with robustness allows stakeholders to explicitly trade-off incremental increases in robustness with investment costs for a given level of risk. We illustrate the framework through a case study of London's water supply system using state-of-the -art regional climate simulations to inform the estimation of risk and robustness.},

For transitioning toward groundwater resource sustainability, specific adaptive management policies should be developed to achieve prespecified goals. Focusing on demand side measures, this paper develops and applies a hydro-economic based multi-objective optimization model for sustainable groundwater management. Solution to the model develops a tradeoff surface between possible loss to long-term agricultural profit, groundwater level, and required energy for groundwater pumping. Farming practice and cropping pattern, quantity and timing of groundwater pumping, and energy consumption are optimized for transitioning toward long term groundwater sustainability. The simulation model is coupled with a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm for developing a set of non-dominated optimal solutions for sustaining groundwater table in a groundwater basin in Isfahan, Iran. Recovery time of transitioning to groundwater sustainability is dynamically varied to assess the impact of different strategies on agricultural economy, mean annual groundwater level drop, and required energy for pumping. Results show that the optimal strategy for sustaining groundwater level at its present condition would result in 17\% reduction in agricultural profit to the region. The same strategy would reduce energy use for groundwater pumping by more than 19\%, compared to the business as usual strategy.},

In this research, we used the Central Valley hydrologic model (CVHM) to model how crop types and drought scenarios impact groundwater storage throughout the Central Valley. Simulations that decreased the abundance of water-intensive crops, such as fruits and nuts, observed the largest recovery in groundwater storage. Two drought scenarios, which respectively decreased surface water availability by 25\% and 75\%, were also tested. Combined drought and crop type scenarios were explored to understand the relative influence of either surface condition on groundwater storage. The results showed that water-intensive crops can decrease groundwater storage by over 20 m under water deficit conditions, whereas water-saving crops can recover groundwater storage and alleviate the impact of droughts. This research suggests that under drought conditions, groundwater storage will decline substantially to compensate for the need of water-intensive crops due to loss of surface water. Policy and management implications from this research suggest decreasing water demands, such as decreasing crop water intensity, can mitigate groundwater depletion.},

We created a 270-m coupled model of land-use and groundwater conditions, LUCAS-W[ater], for California’s Central Coast. This groundwater-dependent region is undergoing a dramatic reorganization of groundwater management under California’s 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA).
Study Focus
Understanding land-use and land-cover change supports long-term sustainable water management. Anthropogenic water demand has depleted groundwater aquifers worldwide, while future water shortages will likely affect land-use change, creating system feedbacks. Our novel participatory approach fused changes in land-use and associated water use from county-scale data to local water agencies’ estimates of total sustainable supply, scaling up local hydro-geologic knowledge from heterogeneous aquifers and diverse management approaches to a regional level. We assessed five stakeholder-driven scenarios with the same historic rates of urban and agricultural land-use change, but different water and land-use management, analyzing how management strategies altered both the spatial pattern of development and subsequent water sustainability from 2001 to 2061.
New Hydrological Insights for the Region
Transformative strategies using demand-side interventions that coupled water availability to land-use more effectively achieved long-term sustainability than adaptive strategies using supply-side interventions to increase water supplies. Limiting water withdrawals within SGMA regulated basins resulted in leakage of development into unregulated basins, increasing groundwater pumping there. Protecting ecosystems, farmlands, and recharge areas from development reduced leakage into undeveloped basins without negatively affecting water sustainability.},

	abstract = {Groundwater sustainability may refer to its exploitation and use for the present needs while maintaining the resource for future generations without unacceptable environmental, economic, and social consequences. For transitioning toward groundwater resource sustainability, specific adaptive management policies should be developed to achieve prespecified goals. Focusing on demand side measures, this paper develops and applies a hydro-economic based multi-objective optimization model for sustainable groundwater management. Solution to the model develops a tradeoff surface between possible loss to long-term agricultural profit, groundwater level, and required energy for groundwater pumping. Farming practice and cropping pattern, quantity and timing of groundwater pumping, and energy consumption are optimized for transitioning toward long term groundwater sustainability. The simulation model is coupled with a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm for developing a set of non-dominated optimal solutions for sustaining groundwater table in a groundwater basin in Isfahan, Iran. Recovery time of transitioning to groundwater sustainability is dynamically varied to assess the impact of different strategies on agricultural economy, mean annual groundwater level drop, and required energy for pumping. Results show that the optimal strategy for sustaining groundwater level at its present condition would result in 17\% reduction in agricultural profit to the region. The same strategy would reduce energy use for groundwater pumping by more than 19\%, compared to the business as usual strategy.},

	abstract = {Low-income, rural frontline communities of California's Central Valley experience environmental and socioeconomic injustice, water insecurity, extremely poor air quality, and lack of fundamental infrastructure (sewage, green areas, health services), which makes them less resilient. Many communities depend ﬁnancially on agriculture, while water scarcity and associated policy may trigger farmland retirement further hindering socioeconomic opportunities. Here we propose a multi-beneﬁt framework to repurpose cropland in buffers inside and around (400-m and 1600-m buffers) 154 rural disadvantaged communities of the Central Valley to promote socioeconomic opportunities, environmental beneﬁts, and business diversiﬁcation. We estimate the potential for (1) reductions in water and pesticide use, nitrogen leaching, and nitrogen gas emissions, (2) managed aquifer recharge, and (3) economic and employment impacts associated with clean industries and solar energy. Retiring cropland within 1600-m buffers can result in reductions in water use of 2.18 km3/year, nitrate leaching into local aquifers of 105,500 t/year, greenhouse gas emissions of 2,232,000 t CO2-equivalent/year, and 5388 t pesticides/year, with accompanying losses in agricultural revenue of US\$4213 million/year and employment of 25,682 positions. Buffer repurposing investments of US\$27 million/year per community for ten years show potential to generate US\$101 million/year per community (total US\$15,578 million/year) for 30 years and 407 new jobs/year (total 62,697 jobs/year) paying 67 \% more than prior farmworker jobs. In the San Joaquin Valley (southern Central Valley), where groundwater overdraft averages 2.3 km3/year, potential water use reduction is 1.8 km3/year. We have identiﬁed 99 communities with surﬁcial soils adequate for aquifer recharge and canals/rivers within 1600 m. This demonstrates the potential of managed aquifer recharge in buffered zones to substantially reduce overdraft. The buffers framework shows that well-planned land repurposing near disadvantaged communities can create multiple beneﬁts for farmers and industry stakeholders, while improving quality of life in disadvantaged communities and producing positive externalities for society.},

	abstract = {Groundwater provides nearly half of irrigation water supply, and it enables resilience during drought, but in many regions of the world, it remains poorly, if at all managed. In heavily agricultural regions like California’s Central Valley, where groundwater management is being slowly implemented over a 27-year period that began in 2015, groundwater provides two–thirds or more of irrigation water during drought, which has led to falling water tables, drying wells, subsiding land, and its long-term disappearance. Here we use nearly two decades of observations from NASA’s GRACE satellite missions and show that the rate of groundwater depletion in the Central Valley has been accelerating since 2003 (1.86 km3/yr, 1961–2021; 2.41 km3/yr, 2003–2021; 8.58 km3/yr, 2019–2021), a period of megadrought in southwestern North America. Results suggest the need for expedited implementation of groundwater management in the Central Valley to ensure its availability during the increasingly intense droughts of the future.},

	abstract = {Assessing impacts on coupled food-water systems that may emerge from water policies, changes in economic drivers and crop productivity requires an understanding of dominant uncertainties. This paper assesses how a candidate groundwater pumping restriction and crop prices, crop yields, surface water price, electricity price, and parametric uncertainties shape economic and groundwater performance metrics from a coupled hydro-economic model (HEM) through a diagnostic global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The HEM used in this study integrates a groundwater depth response, modeled by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), into a calibrated Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) agricultural production model. Results show that in addition to a groundwater pumping restriction, performance metrics are highly sensitive to prices and yields of perennial tree crops. These sensitivities become salient during dry years when there is a higher reliance on groundwater. Furthermore, results indicate that performing a GSA for two different water baseline conditions used to calibrate the production model, dry and wet, result in different sensitivity indices magnitudes and factor prioritization. Diagnostic GSA results are used to understand key factors that affect the performance of a groundwater pumping restriction policy. This research is applied to the Wheeler Ridge-Maricopa Water Storage District located in Kern County, California, region reliant on groundwater and vulnerable to surface water shortages.},

Nevertheless, their participation in these off-farm reform processes has received limited research attention. This paper investigates farmer participation in state-mandated common-pool resource governance. Using groundwater governance in California as a case study, we show that existing social networks, in combination with asymmetries in resource access within the farming community, and a collective identity framed against central government intervention, explain participation and representation in groundwater governance processes. An important governance paradox has emerged, in which groundwater-dependent users are unequally represented in the very groundwater management agencies that have been developed to protect them. This case sheds light on documented shortcomings of common-pool resource governance reforms and aims to inform the design of future reform processes.},

	abstract = {California’s geography and Mediterranean, semi-arid climate has attracted both a burgeoning population and one of the largest irrigated agricultural developments in the world. Water resources are important to the livelihood of the state. With dry summers and highly variable annual winter precipitation, groundwater is a critical resource, drought buffer, and long-term storage reservoir for the state. Only during the most recent five-year drought, California adopted statutory control of groundwater resources: in 2014, the legislature passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). The law is the most significant California water law reform since the legislature took statutory control of surface water rights in 1914 and of water quality in 1969. This chapter provides an overview of groundwater management during the state’s 150-year history, with often uncontrolled groundwater development, with conflict resolution and groundwater adjudications through the courts in some areas, and continued groundwater overdraft in others. Where courts have set limits on groundwater extraction, the objective has been to ensure stable and reliable groundwater level dynamics to avoid well outages, land subsidence, and seawater intrusion. Shortages are shared in sometimes complicated arrangements among overlying users and prior appropriators of groundwater. Under SGMA, groundwater management decisions will be made at the local level, with state oversight, to achieve long-term sustainability. We explore SGMA’s vision for sustainability, stakeholder engagement, technical-scientific assessment, planning, and infrastructure practices. We also describe the role of state enforcement as a key driver for successful implementation of local groundwater sustainability plans. Importantly, local groundwater management, for the first time, will also need to consider groundwater pumping effects on surface water, on groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and on water quality. Hence, key challenges facing local groundwater management agencies also arise from needing to address overlapping and potentially competing and less well-defined legal doctrines and federal and state laws pertaining surface water rights, ecosystems, and water quality.},

We find that long-term rates of groundwater-level decline and water-quality degradation in critically overdrafted basins accelerate by respective factors of 2–3 and 3–5 during drought, followed by brief reversals during wetter periods. Episodic water-quality degradation can occur during drought where increased pumpage draws shallow, contaminated groundwater down to depth zones tapped by long-screened production wells. These data show, for the first time, a direct linkage between climate-mediated aquifer pumpage and groundwater quality on a regional scale.},

The lack of observations with an adequate spatiotemporal resolution to constrain the evolution of groundwater resources poses severe challenges to water management efforts. Here we present SAR interferometric measurements of high-resolution vertical land motion across the valley, revealing multiscale patterns of aquifer hydrogeological properties and groundwater storage change. Investigating the depletion and degradation of the aquifer-system during 2007–2010, when the entire valley experienced a severe drought, we find that 2\% of total aquifer-system storage was permanently lost, owing to irreversible compaction of the system. Over this period, the seasonal groundwater storage change amplitude of 10.11 ± 2.5 km3 modulates a long-term groundwater storage decline of 21.32 ± 7.2 km3. Estimates for subbasins show more complex patterns, most likely associated with local hydrogeology, recharge, demand, and underground flow. Presented measurements of aquifer-system compaction provide a more complete understanding of groundwater dynamics and can potentially be used to improve water security.},

In the southern portion of the San Joaquin Valley, vertical subsidence as high as 85 cm has been observed between June 2007 and December 2010 using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). This study seeks to map regions where inelastic (not recoverable) deformation occurred during the study period, resulting in permanent compaction and loss of groundwater storage. We estimated the amount of permanent compaction by incorporating multiple data sets: the total deformation derived from InSAR, estimated skeletal-specific storage and hydraulic parameters, geologic information, and measured water levels during our study period. We used two approaches, one that we consider to provide an estimate of the lowest possible amount of inelastic deformation, and one that provides a more reasonable estimate. These two approaches resulted in a spatial distribution of values for the percentage of the total deformation that was inelastic, with the former estimating a spatially averaged value of 54\%, and the latter a spatially averaged value of 98\%. The former corresponds to the permanent loss of m3 of groundwater storage, or roughly 5\% of the volume of groundwater used over the study time period; the latter corresponds to the loss of m3 of groundwater storage, or roughly 9\% of the volume of groundwater used. This study demonstrates that a data-driven approach can be used effectively to estimate the permanent loss of groundwater storage.},

	abstract = {Groundwater depletion is a major threat to agricultural and municipal water supply in California's Central Valley. Recent droughts during 2007–2009 and 2012–2016 exacerbated chronic groundwater depletion. However, it is unclear how much groundwater storage recovered from drought-related overdrafts during post-drought years, and how climatic conditions and water management affected recovery times. We estimated groundwater storage change in the Central Valley for April 2002 through September 2019 using four methods: GRACE satellite data, a water balance approach, a hydrologic simulation model, and monitoring wells. We also evaluated the sensitivity of drought recovery to different climate scenarios (recent climate ± droughts and future climate change scenarios: 20 GCMs and 2 RCPs) using water balance method and statistical sampling of historical climate data. Estimated Central Valley groundwater loss during the two droughts ranged from 19 km3 (2007–2009) to 28 km3 (2012–2016) (median of four methods). Median aquifer storage recovery was 34\% and 19\% of the overdraft during the 2010–2011 and 2017–2019 post-drought years, respectively. Numerical experiments show that recovery times are sensitive to climate forcing, with longer recovery times for a future climate scenario that replicate historical climatology relative to historical forcing with no droughts. Overdraft recovery times decrease by ∼2× with implementation of pumping restrictions (30th to 50th percentiles of historical groundwater depletion) to constrain groundwater depletion relative to no restrictions with a no-drought future climatology. This study highlights the importance of considering water management implications for future drought recoveries within the context of climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {With aquifers around the world stressed by over-extraction, water managers are increasingly turning to managed aquifer recharge (MAR), directly replenishing groundwater resources through injection wells, recharge basins, or other approaches. While there has been progress in understanding the geological and infrastructure-related considerations to make MAR more effective, critical evaluations of its institutional design and implementation are limited. This study assesses MAR projects, using a case study of projects proposed by groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) in California to comply with the state's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014; these projects will almost double the number of MAR projects in the United States. We draw on content analysis of groundwater sustainability plans that propose these projects. We first assess the types of recharge projects proposed and the stated aims of the projects, to assess when and why agencies are turning to MAR as a solution. We find that recharge basins are by far the most common approach, and that GSAs hope these basins will improve water table levels, reduce subsidence, and improve water quality. We then analyze potential barriers to project implementation and assess the projects' ability to achieve the stated goals. Primary concerns identified include a potential lack of available water, a potentially challenging legal framework, and minimal consideration of funding and cumulative land needs. To conclude, we discuss broader considerations for ensuring that MAR is an effective water management tool.},

	abstract = {A uniform, global approach is used to quantify how atmospheric rivers (ARs) change between Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 historical simulations and future projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 warming scenarios. The projections indicate that while there will be 10\% fewer ARs in the future, the ARs will be 25\% longer, 25\% wider, and exhibit stronger integrated water vapor transports (IVTs) under RCP8.5. These changes result in pronounced increases in the frequency (IVT strength) of AR conditions under RCP8.5: 50\% (25\%) globally, 50\% (20\%) in the northern midlatitudes, and 60\% (20\%) in the southern midlatitudes. The models exhibit systematic low biases across the midlatitudes in replicating historical AR frequency ( 10\%), zonal IVT ( 15\%), and meridional IVT ( 25\%), with sizable intermodel differences. A more detailed examination of six regions strongly impacted by ARs suggests that the western United States, northwestern Europe, and southwestern South America exhibit considerable intermodel differences in projected changes in ARs.},

Increasingly, groundwater resources are taking a more prominent role in providing freshwater supplies. We discuss the competing fresh groundwater needs for human consumption, food production, energy, and the environment, as well as physical hazards, and conflicts due to transboundary overexploitation. During the past 50 years, groundwater management modeling has focused on combining simulation with optimization methods to inspect important problems ranging from contaminant remediation to agricultural irrigation management. The compound challenges now faced by water planners require a new generation of aquifer management models that address the broad impacts of global change on aquifer storage and depletion trajectory management, land subsidence, groundwater-dependent ecosystems, seawater intrusion, anthropogenic and geogenic contamination, supply vulnerability, and long-term sustainability. The scope of research efforts is only beginning to address complex interactions using multiagent system models that are not readily formulated as optimization problems and that consider a suite of human behavioral responses.},

We argue that a sustainable plan should not only achieve economic, environmental, and social objectives, but should be robust and able to be adapted over time to (unforeseen) future conditions. Large numbers of papers dealing with robustness and adaptive plans have begun to appear, but the literature is fragmented. The papers appear in disparate journals, and deal with a wide variety of policy domains. This paper (1) describes and compares a family of related conceptual approaches to designing a sustainable plan, and (2) describes several computational tools supporting these approaches. The conceptual approaches all have their roots in an approach to long-term planning called Assumption-Based Planning. Guiding principles for the design of a sustainable adaptive plan are: explore a wide variety of relevant uncertainties, connect short-term targets to long-term goals over time, commit to short-term actions while keeping options open, and continuously monitor the world and take actions if necessary.  A key computational tool across the conceptual approaches is a fast, simple  (policy analysis) model that is used to make large numbers of runs, in order to explore the full range of uncertainties and to identify situations in which the plan would fail.},

Though several HEMs reviews have been conducted in the recent past, none of them focused on the management of transboundary river water disputes, benefit sharing, or trade-offs. Therefore, this review explored how HEMs can suggest mitigating water sharing disputes on transboundary rivers. Though more than 300 HEMs have been developed worldwide, very few focused on transboundary river water disputes. After vigorous screening at Google Scholar, only 25 articles were found which focused on transboundary river water disputes. Most HEMs that were reviewed proposed to share benefits such as sharing hydropower produced from the river, reallocating water from low-value agriculture to high-value agriculture or managed operation of the dam, or other monetary compensation. But no study assessed non-water sector benefit sharing such as trade or transit. Most HEMs focused on irrigation and hydropower which are benefits from the river and very few studies focused on fisheries, environment, and wetland which are benefits to the river. International rivers can act as a catalyst among the riparian countries and promote cooperation in trade, commerce, exchange of technologies, and other fields. HEMs can play an important role in this regard. It is to be mentioned that HEMs cannot resolve water conflicts in a shared basin, they only can propose for the options of solution.},

	abstract = {This study examines climate change and water resources management challenges facing water suppliers in drought-prone regions and is particularly relevant to the American West, where agencies balance the management of imported and local water resources across multiple future uncertainties. We apply Robust Decision Making (RDM) to water management planning chal­ lenges facing the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District (Valley District) and investigate the performance of a machine learning-based representation of two local groundwater basins. To do so, we assess three machine learning methods–Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)–and their ability to simulate the output of a highresolution MODFLOW model. We find that RF produces the most accurate results, and thus we incorporate the RF version of the MODFLOW model into the study’s RDM approach. This con­ stitutes an advancement to the field of decisionmaking under deep uncertainty (DMDU) through a novel application of machine learning that shortens modeling run times and allows for a greater exploration of the uncertainty space, including a broad range of future climate changes and drought conditions. This paper also constitutes an advancement to the field of empirical groundwater modeling by showing that RF is capable of simulating average basin groundwater level changes. Our results also suggest that demand management can significantly reduce vul­ nerabilities to drought and other climate changes, and we provide recommendations on addi­ tional adaptive management options and key signposts to track for the Valley District.},

This paper evaluates how users and public authorities can co-manage groundwater extraction by agriculture. Based on Schlager and Ostrom’s “bundle of rights” framework, the paper examines how decisions over access and use of groundwater resources are made in France, Spain and California. The three cases share a common strive to involve groundwater users in decisions over how to reduce over extraction of groundwater resources. However, different choices were made regarding the institutional set-up for user involvement in allocation decisions. The paper presents the diversity of institutional arrangements influencing groundwater allocations in the three cases, and the relative involvement and power of users and public authorities over these institutions. The papers show the different ways in which “comanagement” may be made operational for managing agricultural groundwater use.},

We assessed the potential climate-driven impacts on GWS changes throughout the 21st century under the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Results show that the climate-driven impacts on GWS changes do not necessarily reflect the long-term trend in precipitation; instead, the trend may result from enhancement of evapotranspiration, and reduction in snowmelt, which collectively lead to divergent responses of GWS changes across different aquifers. Finally, we compare the climate-driven and anthropogenic pumping impacts. The reduction in GWS is mainly due to the combined impacts of over-pumping and climate effects; however, the contribution of pumping could easily far exceed the natural replenishment.},

During the severe 2014 drought, water management alleviated the drought deficit by ∼50\% in Southern California through reservoir operation during low-flow periods. However, human water consumption (mostly irrigation) in the Central Valley increased drought duration and deficit by 50\% and 50–100\%, respectively. Return level analysis indicates that there is more than 50\% chance that the probability of occurrence of an extreme 2014 magnitude drought event was at least doubled under the influence of human activities compared to natural variability. This impact is most significant over the San Joaquin Drainage basin with a 50\% and 75\% likelihood that the return period is more than 3.5 and 1.5 times larger, respectively, because of human activities.},

Here, we use California as a testbed to assess the ET impacts of changing atmospheric conditions induced by climate change on irrigated systems. Our analysis of irrigated agricultural and urban regions shows that warmer atmospheric temperatures have minimal implications for ET rates and irrigation water demands—about one percent change per degree Celsius warming (∼1\% °C−1). By explicitly modeling irrigation, we control for the confounding effect of climate-driven soil moisture changes and directly estimate water demand implications. Our attribution analysis of the drivers of ET response to global anthropogenic warming shows that as the atmospheric temperature and vapor pressure deficit depart from the ideal conditions for transpiration, regulation of stomata resistance by stressed vegetation almost completely offsets the expected increase in ET rates that would otherwise result from abiotic processes alone. We further show that anthropogenic warming of the atmosphere has minimal implications for mean relative humidity ({\textless}1.7\% °C−1) and the surface available energy ({\textless}0.2\% °C−1), which are critical drivers of ET. This study corroborates the growing evidence that plant physiological changes moderate the degree to which changes in potential ET are realized as actual ET.},

	abstract = {Recent high impact wildfires and droughts in California and Nevada have been linked to extremes in the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), respectively. Both indices are dependent on reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Future changes in ET0 for California and Nevada are examined, calculated from global climate model simulations downscaled by Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA). ET0 increases of 13–18\% at seasonal timescales are projected by late century (2070–2099), with greatest relative increases in winter and spring. Seasonal ET0 increases are most strongly driven by warmer temperatures, with increasing specific humidity having a smaller, but noteworthy, counter tendency. Extreme (95th percentile) EDDI values on the 2-week timescale have coincided with recent large wildfires in the area. Two-week EDDI extremes are projected to increase by 6–10 times during summer and 4–6 times during autumn by the end of the century. On multiyear timescales, the occurrence of extreme droughts based on 3-year SPEI below the historical fifth percentile, similar to that experienced during the 2012–2016 drought across the region, is projected to increase 3–15 times by late century. Positive trends in extreme multiyear droughts will further increase seasonal fire potential through degraded forests and increased fuel loads and flammability. Understanding how these drought metrics change on various climate timescales at the local level can provide fundamental information to support the development of long-term adaptation strategies for wildland fire and water resource management.},

	abstract = {Groundwater plays a critical role in sustaining agriculture in California's Central Valley (CV). However, groundwater storage in the CV has been declining by around 3 km3/year over the last several decades, with much larger declines during the 2007–2009 and 2012–2015 droughts. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) can potentially mitigate existing overdraft by recharging excess streamflows (during flood periods) to the aquifers. However, the degree to which the existing CV groundwater overdraft might be mitigated by MAR is unknown. We applied a coupled surface water-groundwater simulation model to quantify the potential for groundwater overdraft recovery via MAR. To quantify the potential benefit of MAR, we used the coupled surface water-groundwater model to simulate water allocation scenarios where streamflow above the 90th or 80th percentiles was reallocated to aquifers, subject to constraints on the maximum depth of applied water (0.61 and 3.05 m). Our results show that MAR could recover 9–22\% of the existing groundwater overdraft CV-wide based on a 56-year simulation (1960–2015). However, the impact of MAR varies strongly among regions. In the southern CV where groundwater depletion is most serious, the contribution of MAR to the overdraft recovery would be small, only 2.7–3.2\% in the Tulare basin and 3.2–7.8\% in the San Joaquin basin. However, transferring excess winter flow from the northern to the southern CV for MAR would increase the overdraft recovery to 30\% in San Joaquin and 62\% in Tulare. Our results also indicate that MAR has the potential to supplement summer low flows (52–73\%, CV-wide) and reduce flood peaks.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase the scarcity and variability of fresh water supplies in some regions with important implications for irrigated agriculture. By allowing for increased flexibility in response to scarcity and by incentivizing the allocation of water to higher value use, markets can play an important role in limiting the economic losses associated with droughts. Using data on water demand, the seniority of water rights, county agricultural reports, high-resolution data on cropping patterns, and agronomic estimates of crop water requirements, we estimate the benefits of market-based allocations of surface water for California’s Central Valley. Specifically, we estimate the value of irrigation water and compare the agricultural costs of water shortages under the existing legal framework and under an alternate system that allows for trading of water. We find that a more efficient allocation of curtailments could reduce the costs of water shortages by as much as \$362 million dollars per year or 4.4\% of the net agricultural revenue in California in expectation, implying that institutional and market reform may offer important opportunities for adaptation.},

	abstract = {Mitigating the predicted impacts of climate change requires rapid expansion of renewable energy production, including Utility-Scale Solar Energy (USSE) on an unprecedented scale. In the US, a significant share of planned USSE targets working lands—particularly farms and ranches—yet the decision factors informing private landowners’ decisions to host USSE on their lands are little understood. Our research addresses this gap through a qualitative case study of working lands in California’s San Joaquin Valley and San Francisco Bay Area, based on 60 interviews with farmers and ranchers, solar developers, and community and government organizations. Applying land system science and agricultural decision-making theory, we find that landowner decisions to host USSE are based on profit-maximization, water availability, visual and ecological landscape values, and agricultural land preservation ethic. Solar interest varies across landowner types, with farmers typically maximizing operational income while maintaining agricultural production, and ranchers often prioritizing lifestyle-related landscape benefits. The current feasibility of integrating solar with agriculture appears to be low beyond sheep grazing, with benefits and drawbacks discussed in detail. Optimal areas for future USSE development include farmlands with declining water availability, lands without permanent crops or high amenity value, and regions with energy-intensive agricultural operations. Study findings can inform state land use planning and community engagement by solar developers.},

	abstract = {Depletion and pollution of groundwater, Earth's largest and most accessible freshwater stock, is a global sustainability concern. A changing climate, marked by more frequent and intense hydrologic extremes, poses threats to groundwater recharge and amplifies groundwater use. However, widespread human development and contamination of groundwater reservoirs pose an immediate threat of resource extinction with impacts in many regions with dense population or intensive agriculture. A rapid increase in global groundwater studies has emerged, but this has also highlighted the extreme paucity of data for substantive trend analyses and assessment of the state of the global resource. Noting the difficulty in seeing and measuring this typically invisible resource, we discuss factors that determine the current state of global groundwater, including the uncertainties accompanying data and modeling, with an eye to identifying emerging issues and the prospects for informing local to global resource management in critical regions. We comment on some prospective management strategies.},
